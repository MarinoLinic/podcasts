Samo Burja on Curtis Yarvin and the Evolution of American Political Thought

Summary:
Samo Burja dissects the recent discourse surrounding Curtis Yarvin, challenging the popular argument that corporate governance works solely due to market "natural selection." Burja argues that corporations do not evolve; they are Intelligently Designed by founders and decay into "Dead Players" (like Apple) without constant reinvention. The discussion moves to the dangers of "Headless Government" (exemplified by the Biden administration), arguing that gridlock is not a safety feature but a death spiral that allows the "weeds" of bureaucracy to strangle society. Burja analyzes the high opportunity costs of bad government (stalled Alzheimer’s research, Canadian assisted suicide, urban decay, the "Shaving Cream Index") and credits Yarvin with shifting the Right from losing Libertarian strategies to high-agency power politics.

1. The Corporate Governance Fallacy: Intelligent Design, Not Evolution

- The Dispute:
-- The Argument (Dwarkesh Patel): Curtis Yarvin is wrong to compare government to Apple. Apple works because of the market's "Natural Selection"—bad CEOs are punished, good ones are rewarded. Governments lack this pressure, so a "CEO of America" represents an unbounded risk (e.g., Mao/Stalin) without the corrective mechanism of bankruptcy.
-- Samo’s Rebuttal: This relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of biology. Corporations do not undergo natural selection.
-- No Heritable Variance: Corporations do not reproduce. Spin-offs are new entities, not "offspring" carrying DNA. There is no mechanism for "traits" to be passed down and selected for over generations.
-- No Evolution: Functional institutions are not "evolved" by market pressures; they are Intelligently Designed by founders (Live Players).

- The "Dead Player" Reality:
-- Apple as a Case Study: Apple is currently a functional institution, but a "Dead Player." It persists on the momentum of Steve Jobs’ original design. It does not adapt; it extracts.
-- The Prediction: Burja predicts Apple will eventually be blindsided and outcompeted by a Chinese firm or a new US innovator because it has lost the ability to write new scripts.
-- The Board Problem: Corporate boards act like committees/legislatures. They seek consensus and safety. A board would never have voted to acquire Twitter (an Elon hostile takeover) or launch SpaceX. Markets allocate resources (machines/employees), but they do not generate internal agency.

- Market Discipline vs. Market Creation:
-- Burja concedes that markets are excellent at Creative Destruction. If GM is failing, the market ensures the robots and engineers are reallocated to Tesla.
-- However, the market cannot fix GM's internal culture. Only a Live Player can do that. Therefore, relying on "market forces" to fix governance is a category error.

2. The "Unbounded Downside" of Government

- The Dictator Myth:
-- Critics argue a single leader has "unbounded downside" (Genocide, Famine).
-- Counter-Point: The disasters of the 20th century (Mao’s China, Soviet Russia) were arguably failures of Ideology/Policy, not just leadership structure.
-- Mao's Accountability: Burja notes that Mao was actually removed from power/sidelined multiple times by the CCP before his death. Even in a dictatorship, there are checks. Stalin was the outlier (total control), not the rule.
-- Committee Tyranny: If you replaced Stalin with a "Committee of Bolsheviks," the Ukrainian Famine likely still happens because the Marxist theory of agriculture was wrong. The French Revolution’s "Committee on Public Safety" was a group of equals, yet it was just as murderous as a king.

- The "Gridlock is Safety" Fallacy:
-- The modern American argument is that gridlock (divided government) prevents tyranny.
-- Samo’s Counter: Gridlock prevents Correction. A gridlocked government cannot prune the "weeds" of bureaucracy.
-- The China Threat: If the US government remains a static, gridlocked dinosaur, it doesn't stay "safe"; it gets eaten. China is not gridlocked. It makes cars, AI, and chips (e.g., Deep Seek). If the US cannot make decisions, it loses the geopolitical competition by default.

3. Bureaucratic Entropy: The "Garden of Weeds"

- The Law of Decay:
-- Bureaucracies function best on Day 1. They are automated scripts performing a function.
-- From Day 2 onward, they decay. They accumulate graft, overstaffing, and mission creep.
-- The Garden Metaphor: A government without a "Gardener" (Live Player) is a garden where the fastest-growing weeds (corruption/inefficiency) strangle the trees.
-- Singapore: It works now because of Lee Kuan Yew’s recent legacy. In 50 years, without a reset, Singapore’s civil service will look like the DMV.

- The Cost of Inefficiency (It’s Not Just Money):
-- We treat bad government as a "nuisance" (taxes, lines). Burja argues the cost is Human Atrocity.
-- Alzheimer’s Fraud: The NIH/FDA bureaucracy has poured billions into fraudulent Alzheimer’s research for decades, protecting prestige over progress. The cost is hundreds of millions of melting brains.
-- Canadian MAID: The Canadian bureaucracy realized it is cheaper to euthanize sick people (Medical Assistance in Dying) than to treat them. Bureaucratic efficiency, without moral leadership, leads to state-sanctioned suicide.
-- San Francisco: The "Headless Government" of SF allows people to rot alive on the streets because no one has the authority to force treatment or enforce laws.

- The "Shaving Cream Index":
-- Burja points to the locking up of shaving cream in SF drugstores as a metric of societal failure.
-- An "Inconvenient Convenience Store" represents a death spiral of trust. If you cannot buy basic goods without an attendant, you are living in a low-trust, dysfunctional society ("Universal LA" where you never leave your house).

4. COVID: A Case Study in Agency

- China (High Agency, Bad Policy):
-- China made a mistake (Zero COVID), maintained it too long, but eventually reversed it. The One Child Policy was a 50-year disaster of high agency, but it was eventually repealed.

- USA (No Agency, Bad Policy):
-- The US had a "Headless" response. We had lockdowns despite being a "free" country, but they were uncoordinated and ineffective. We got the economic damage without the health benefit.
-- The Information Control: Western governments tried to block free discussion of vaccines/origins, destroying trust.

- Sweden (The Bureaucratic Success):
-- Sweden is the only Western nation that acted like a Live Player. They bucked the global consensus ("Young people go to the beach, old people stay home").
-- This required Bureaucratic Courage. It resulted in fewer excess deaths and less economic damage than the "Headless" US approach.

5. Curtis Yarvin and the "New Right"

- The Gadfly/Building Inspector:
-- Burja views Yarvin not as a prophet to be obeyed, but as a "Building Inspector." He checks the code. You don't have to agree with his solution (Monarchy/Patchwork) to admit his report on the foundation (Oligarchy/Managerialism) is accurate.

- The Shift from Libertarianism to Power:
-- Yarvin’s greatest contribution was telling Silicon Valley Libertarians: "You are losing. You are bringing a knife to a gunfight."
-- He shifted the intellectual energy from "Leave me alone" (Libertarian) to "We need to seize the state to reform it" (New Right/Tech Right).

- The "Liberal on a Lag" Theory:
-- Yarvin exposed that the "Conservative" movement is just Progressivism with a speed limit. Republicans eventually accept every left-wing premise (affirmative action, civil rights expansions), just 20 years later.
-- The Trump reversal: Trump's recent moves to undo affirmative action via executive order show a break from this "Lag" pattern—Republicans finally using power to reverse, not just slow, the trend.

- The Rehabilitation:
-- Ten years ago, reading Moldbug got you fired from Google. Today, his readers sit in the front row of the Inauguration.
-- Chomsky Parallel: Just as Noam Chomsky was radical but eventually accepted as a "fixture" who was 40% right, Yarvin is becoming the "shadow intellectual" of the new administration.

6. The Future of US Governance

- Congress vs. The President:
-- Burja argues Congress is less democratic than the President.
-- Congress is a "Seniority System" (Gerontocracy) that has devolved all real power to unelected agencies (the "Deep State"). Congressmen don't even know how DARPA works.
-- The Presidency is the only remaining mechanism where a democratic mandate can theoretically pierce the bureaucracy.

- The "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) Context:
-- The discussion (implicitly referencing the incoming Trump/Musk/Vivek era) centers on whether a "Hostile Takeover" of the US bureaucracy is possible.
-- The Pentagon Problem: Burja notes the Pentagon could be cut by 50% without losing lethality. The corruption is structural: The "Retirement Package" for generals is a board seat at Boeing.
-- The Boeing Drone: Boeing doesn't lobby for drones because drones are cheap. They lobby for jets because jets are expensive. Reforming this requires a Live Player willing to break the "Iron Triangle."

7. Advice: The Intellectual Gym

- Read What You Hate:
-- Burja laments the cowardice of modern intellectuals who are afraid to read "dangerous" authors.
-- Reading Yarvin (or Marx, or anyone radical) is "Ideological Gym." It strengthens your own worldview by forcing you to grapple with a coherent, alien logic.
-- The Digital Republic of Letters: The 1990s promise of the internet (anonymous, high-level discourse) was briefly realized in the blogosphere that produced Yarvin. While social media is a "memetic sewer," the long-form blogosphere remains the incubator for the ideas that eventually rule the world.
