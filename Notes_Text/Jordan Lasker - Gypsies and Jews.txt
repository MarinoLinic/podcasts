Jordan Lasker on Gypsies and Jews

Summary: An analysis of how "selective identification" skews group statistics and reputations. Cremieux cites new data showing that high-status Gypsies stop identifying as Gypsies (making the group appear lower-class), whereas historically, low-status Jews left Judaism (making the group appear higher-class). The article argues that these filtering processes fundamentally alter both the demographic reality and the public perception of these ethnic groups.

1. The Gypsy "Passing" Phenomenon (Romanian Data)

- The Context: "Received wisdom" in Europe holds that Gypsies are prone to crime, poor, and uneducated.

- The Hypothesis: Because the group is stigmatized, high-status individuals essentially "defect" from the identity, leaving only the low-status individuals visible.

- The Study (Mitrut et al.):
-- Used Romanian administrative data tracking millions of individuals over years.
-- "Desistence": Measured how often individuals stopped identifying as Roma/Gypsy compared to other minorities (e.g., Hungarians).

- The Findings:
-- Educational Gradient: Gypsies "selectively desist." The more educated/wealthy a Gypsy becomes, the more likely they are to identify as Romanian or Hungarian.
-- Magnitude of Passing: More than half of Gypsies who become professionals change their ethnic self-identification.

- The Statistical Distortion:
-- Official Data: Reports 2.3% of the population is Roma.
-- Actual Data: Likely 3.7%–4.1%.
-- The "Elite" Undercount: Official data misses the vast majority of successful Roma. There are 6x more Roma post-secondary graduates in reality than in the census.

- Public Perception vs. Reality:
-- In a survey, Romanians claimed they could identify Gypsies by clothes, skin color, or speech.
-- *Reality:* They failed to identify the "passing" Gypsies. Because the public only sees the low-class Gypsies who *don't* pass, the negative stereotypes are reinforced by a sampling error. Accounting for "passing" explains ~13% of the Roma education gap.

2. Comparative Ethnic Attrition
Cremieux notes that "Ethnic Attrition"—where immigrants stop identifying with their ancestral group—skews data for other groups as well.

- Scots-Irish: Largely vanished into the generic "American" identity.

- African Immigrants: Downwardly mobile descendants tend to identify as generic "Black" rather than "African," making statistics on African immigrants look "unduly optimistic" (because the failures filter out of the data set).

- Mexican Americans: The opposite trend. Less successful ones stick to the "Mexican" label; successful ones intermarry and identify as white/mixed, making the remaining "Mexican" pool appear less assimilated than it actually is.

3. The Jewish Selection Event (The Inverse of the Gypsy Story)
While smart Gypsies leave the group (lowering the average), the historical success of Jews is driven by poor Jews leaving the group (raising the average).

A. The Origins (Judea & The Pharisees)

- The Mechanism: After the fall of the Second Temple, the Pharisees (scholars) wrested control from the Sadducees (priests).

- The Ordinance: They required Jewish fathers to educate their sons in literacy/Torah.

- The Cost: In a Malthusian farming society, education was prohibitively expensive.

- The Filter: Uneducated Jews became Am Ha’aretz ("People of the Land")—outcasts. To avoid stigma and cost, the poor/uneducated converted to Christianity.
-- *Result:* Judaism became a religion of the literate/wealthy by shedding its lower class.

B. The Islamic Golden Age (800–1200 AD)

- Urbanization: Unlike the Romans, Muslims encouraged urbanization. This gave Jews a market for their literacy.

- The Transition: Jews moved en masse from farming to skilled crafts, trade, and lending.

- The Jizya Tax: Muslims charged a head tax (*Jizya*) on non-Muslims. Poor Jews who couldn't pay converted to Islam.

- Result: By 1200 AD, the Jewish population was small, highly urban, highly literate, and occupationally distinct.

C. Migration to Europe & The "Rift"

- Selective Immigration: European rulers invited Jews specifically to fill high-skill niches (lending, treasury, tax collection) that Christians could not fill.

- The Mongol Shock (1250s): The Mongol invasion devastated the Middle East, pushing Middle Eastern Jews back into poverty/farming.

- The Rift: At the same time, European expulsions (England, France) closed the borders.

- Outcome: A split formed between the decimated Middle Eastern Jewish community and the hyper-selected, high-IQ European Jewish community.

4. Conclusion: The Power of Selective Identification

- The Gypsy Model: High-status members exit → The group appears worse than it is. (Reinforces negative stereotypes).

- The Jewish Model: Low-status members exit → The group appears better than it is. (Creates an elite demographic profile).

- Final Insight: Group identity is not a fixed biological container; it is a leaky vessel where the "leaks" (who leaves and who stays) determine the sociological destiny of the group.
