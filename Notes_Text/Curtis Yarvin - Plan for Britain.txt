Curtis Yarvin on Plan for Britain

Summary:
Here are comprehensive notes from the interview with Curtis Yarvin on the Anglo Futurism Podcast.

---

1. Introduction: The King Charles III Space Station

- The Setting:
-- The interview takes place in a conceptual "King Charles III Space Station."
-- Arrival: Curtis Yarvin arrives via a hot air balloon powered by his own "magnificent hot air"—a self-deprecating joke about his voluminous writing output.
-- Airship Physics: Yarvin discusses the actual feasibility of airships to space. It requires a massive balloon for buoyancy in the upper stratosphere, followed by rocket acceleration once in a vacuum (since space is about velocity, not just altitude).

2. The State of the West: The "Banana" vs. The Wasteland

- The "Preference Cascade":
-- We are currently living through a moment where ideas that were once impossible to voice are becoming mainstream.
-- *Example:* Normal people with normal jobs are now openly questioning the validity of the social contract, realizing that things like a "British passport" are just pieces of paper if the state cannot enforce order.

- The "Banana" (Elysium):
-- There are specific geographic zones of prosperity that function like the movie *Elysium*.
-- London: The "Banana" (a curved geographic zone stretching from Hampstead/Highgate down to Clapham/Richmond).
-- California: Palo Alto/Silicon Valley.
-- *The Vibe:* These areas feel like an "alternate present" where World War I never happened. They are manicured, beautiful, and completely detached from the reality of the rest of the country.

- The Wasteland (The Andromeda Strain):
-- Outside these bubbles, the West is a "burned-out wasteland."
-- The Russell, Kansas Anecdote: Yarvin recounts driving through Russell, Kansas (Bob Dole's hometown) in 2021.
-- The town was not just quiet due to COVID; it was populated by "shambling zombies."
-- There were no restaurants open, no life; the town had been completely hollowed out.
-- The Ohio Anecdote: Columbus, Ohio (formerly an industrial powerhouse) is now full of crumbling mansions and has been taken over by urban decay and foreign populations (Haitians/Somalis).
-- *Conclusion:* The defining feature of the modern West is the stark contrast between the preserved reality of the "Banana" and the "Andromeda Strain" reality of the interior.

3. Sociology of Labor: The Deliveroo Economy vs. Slavery

- Defining Slavery:
-- Yarvin introduces a sociological definition of slavery inspired by Robert Nozick (*Tale of a Slave*).
-- Social Disconnection: Slavery exists fundamentally when the people who serve you are completely removed from your social network.
-- The Deliveroo/Uber Economy: In the modern gig economy, there is zero social connection between the customer and the server. They are alien to one another.
-- *Personal Example:* Yarvin contrasts his current cleaner (a friend of his wife) with previous cleaners (illegal Brazilian immigrants with whom he had 10 degrees of social separation).

- Historical Context (Feudal/Victorian):
-- In the past, servants were part of the "family" structure (the etymology of "family" implies dependents).
-- Even if treated poorly, they were integrated into the social fabric. A chauffeur or butler was a lifelong connection.
-- Carlyle’s Critique: The modern "Gig Economy" is the ultimate realization of Thomas Carlyle's warning that "Money is the only nexus between man and man."

- The Liberal Paradox:
-- Liberals intuitively understand this problem, even if they can't name it.
-- The Contradiction: Liberals hate the Gig Economy (impersonal/precarious) but love the Japanese "Salaryman" system (e.g., Toyota).
-- The Toyota Model: In Japan, the corporation provides healthcare, identity, and lifelong security. Workers sing company hymns. It is essentially a form of benevolent slavery or feudalism.
-- *Conclusion:* The fact that liberals prefer the Salaryman model to the Uber model proves they actually desire a return to hierarchical, integrated social bonds, not the "freedom" of the market.

4. The History of English Decline

- The Axial Age (16th Century):
-- Yarvin identifies the 16th Century as the critical turning point for England.
-- Henry VIII: A "metal" king—a true sovereign with absolute power who tolerated no insubordination.

- The Decline under Elizabeth I:
-- While culturally significant, Yarvin argues Elizabeth I represented a decline in sovereignty.
-- The Gender Issue: Yarvin argues her gender led to a tendency to delegate excessive power to the civil service (the Cecils/Walsingham). This was the birth of the "Deep State" or "Platonic Guardians"—bureaucrats who believe they know better than the monarch.
-- The Mary Queen of Scots Incident: The bureaucracy tricked Elizabeth into signing the death warrant and carried it out without her direct command. Henry VIII would have executed the bureaucrats for such insubordination; Elizabeth complained but accepted it.

- The Stuart Failure:
-- James I: An "imported king" (from Scotland) without a domestic power base. His constant insistence on the "Divine Right of Kings" was a sign of weakness (true power doesn't need to constantly assert its text).
-- The Rise of Parliament: The Tudor Parliament was a rubber stamp (like the Supreme Soviet). Under the Stuarts, Parliament began to usurp sovereignty.
-- The Legal Heresy: The English Civil War established the "heresy" that the Law is above the King. Yarvin argues that for a state to function, the Sovereign must be above the law (the Schmittian exception/Royal Prerogative).

5. Monarchy, Oligarchy, and the FDR Pivot

- The American Monarchy Cycle:
-- The US system tends to produce a "King" every 80 years or so.
-- Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR): The last true Monarch/CEO of America. He held absolute power and employed brilliant subordinates.

- The Transition to Oligarchy:
-- When FDR knew he was dying (1944), he chose Harry Truman (a nobody/haberdasher) as his successor rather than a capable heir.
-- The "Pharaonic Move": FDR wanted to be replaced by "nobody." He effectively decapitated the presidency so that his power would flow down into the agencies and bureaucracy.
-- Result: This created the modern "Deep State" or Oligarchy.

- The Stability of Oligarchy:
-- Oligarchies are extremely stable because they run on procedure.
-- There is no procedure for removing the procedure. You cannot vote out an oligarchy.
-- *The Solution:* The only way to fix it is a "Hercules cleaning the Augean Stables" moment—a return to Monarchy (Unity of Command).

6. The Solution for Britain: Restoring Sovereignty

- The Parliamentary Opportunity:
-- Britain has a unique advantage: Parliamentary Sovereignty.
-- *The Maxim:* Parliament can do anything except turn a man into a woman (which modern ideology claims it can do, making Parliament truly omnipotent).
-- The Strategy: Parliament should elect a Prime Minister and vest them with the full, absolute powers of a King.

- The "Cathedral" Sweep:
-- This leader would sweep away the NGOs, the quangos, the Human Rights Act, and the Supreme Court.
-- The Supreme Court Embarrassment: Yarvin mocks the UK Supreme Court as a "younger brother wearing his older brother's clothes." It is an embarrassing imitation of American dysfunction.
-- Return to the Star Chamber: The UK should return to the "Star Chamber"—an unapologetic assertion of executive justice.

- The "Year Zero" Approach:
-- Reform cannot be piecemeal. The analogy is the Allied Military Government of Germany (1945).
-- When the Allies took over, they didn't respect Nazi laws or property rights derived from the Nazi state. It was "Year Zero."
-- A restorative government in the UK needs to view the current system (Blairite reforms, Equality Acts) as illegitimate as the Nazi legal code.
-- The Mauritius/Chagos Example: The giving away of the Chagos Islands was so perverse that Mauritius abolished its income tax because they can now just tax the US/UK for the base. This is a government working actively against its own people.

7. Anglo Futurism: Space and Empire

- The Victorian Vibe:
-- Yarvin identifies as a fan of the High Victorians (Kipling, etc.).
-- Anglo Futurism: Applying that Victorian ambition to the modern age.
-- *Cape to Cairo:* The past dream was a railway; the future dream is a Space Elevator or Hyperloop.

- Elon Musk as the Ultimate Englishman:
-- Musk is South African, which makes him part of the Empire/White Dominions. He represents the last spark of Victorian "can-do" energy.
-- The Tragedy of Mars: Yarvin argues Mars is the "cuck chair." It is running away from Earth.
-- Antarctica: Antarctica is better real estate than Mars. If you can terraform Mars, you can colonize Antarctica. The goal should be to fix Earth (and the Empire), not flee to a radiation-soaked rock.

- The Anglosphere:
-- The internet has reunified the English-speaking world.
-- The discourse is now transatlantic (e.g., "Charlie Kirk memorials in England").
-- The "Young Right" is a singular, global entity sharing the same memes and enemies.

8. Geopolitics: The Fan in Washington

- The "Wind of Change" Myth:
-- Harold Macmillan spoke of the "Wind of Change" decolonizing Africa.
-- Yarvin's Counter: It wasn't a wind; it was a "Fan in Washington." The US Empire (Eisenhower at Suez) forced Britain to decolonize.
-- The Current State: The Fan is off (or on low power).
-- If Britain decided to reassert control over former dominions (e.g., South Africa or Zimbabwe, which are failing), the US likely wouldn't stop them. The "International Community" is a paper tiger.

- The El Salvador Example (Nayib Bukele):
-- Bukele is the proof of concept for the "Just Do Things" philosophy.
-- He ended the reign of terror in El Salvador by ignoring human rights NGOs and the US State Department.
-- Result: 90% approval ratings and safety. Yarvin notes he felt safer carrying a laptop in San Salvador than in San Francisco or London.
-- *Lesson:* In 1975, the CIA would have crushed Bukele. Today, the US Empire is too senile to stop him. Sovereignty is there for the taking.

9. The China/Debt Solution (West Oakland)

- The Problem: The US cannot pay the trillions it owes to China.

- The Proposal: Reverse Extraterritoriality.
-- The US should cede West Oakland (a failed, high-crime area) to China.
-- It becomes a Chinese territory with Chinese police (white gloves, strict order).
-- Win-Win: China gets a foothold in the "Beautiful Country" (America), and Americans get a safe, clean manufacturing zone where they can drink bubble tea without getting mugged.

10. Conclusion: Picking Up the Crown

- The Pornography of Power:
-- Modern democracy is "pornographic." It simulates power for the voter (like watching sports) but offers no actual participation in governance.
-- Voting for the Tories or Labour is like cheering for Chelsea or Man United. It changes nothing.

- The Future of Britain:
-- Britain is fully capable of resuming leadership of the Western world.
-- America is intellectually exhausted and gridlocked.
-- A revitalized Britain, embracing its history and rejecting the "Empire of Love" (Liberalism), could build an Oxbridge that is miles ahead of Harvard.
-- The Napoleon Quote: "The Crown of France is lying in the gutter."
-- The Closing Image: The Crown of the Western World is currently lying in the gutter. It is waiting for someone (a King, a CEO, a Prime Minister with vision) to pick it up with their sword.
