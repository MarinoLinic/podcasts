Wikipedia on History of Islam

Summary:
Summarized Wikipedia article about the history of Islam.

---

1. Historiography and Source Criticism

- The "Oral Gap": Most Islamic history was transmitted orally until the Abbasid period (8th–9th century). The earliest sources are often "founding conquest stories" structured around a "pact-betrayal-redemption" narrative principle.

- John Burton’s Conclusion: Historians can recover "virtually nothing" of Muhammad's life from early sources beyond the bare fact of his existence; the material is too sparse and legendary.

- Four Methodologies:
    1.  Descriptive Method: Follows Islamic traditions but adjusts for miracles (e.g., Edward Gibbon, Gustav Weil).
    2.  Source Critical: Compares sources to identify weak informants (e.g., W. Montgomery Watt, Wilferd Madelung).
    3.  Tradition Critical: Treats sources as evolving oral traditions with unclear origins (pioneered by Ignác Goldziher).
    4.  Skeptical Method: Doubts nearly all material, viewing the "historical core" as undecipherable (e.g., John Wansbrough).

- Reliability Shift: The quality of sources improves drastically after the 8th Century CE with the appearance of official documents, correspondence, and poetry.

- Numismatic Evidence: Early "Pseudo-Byzantine" coins depicted Emperor Constans II with a cross, suggesting a lack of sharp political/religious boundaries in the earliest Islamic period.

2. Inception and Pre-Islamic Arabia

- Context:
-- Geopolitics: 6th-century Arabia faced political disorder and insecure trade routes. Judaism dominated Yemen (Himyarite Kingdom); Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf.
-- The Hanif: A group of "renunciates" who rejected both Arab polytheism and foreign Abrahamic faiths, seeking the original monotheism of Abraham (Allah). They viewed Mecca as originally monotheistic.
-- Mecca: A caravan trading center dominated by the Quraysh clan. They enforced "sacred months" where violence was banned to ensure safe pilgrimage trade to the polytheistic Kaaba.

- Muhammad (c. 570–632 CE):
-- Origins: Born in Mecca. Practiced Taḥannuth (seclusion) at Cave Hira on Jabal al-Nour.
-- Message: At age 40 (610 CE), received revelations (Laylat al-Qadr). Preached strict monotheism, warned of Judgment Day, and castigated social injustice.
-- The Hijra (622 CE): Migrated to Yathrib (Medina) after the death of his protector uncle, Abu Talib.
-- Medina Period: Muhammad established a "constitutional state" via the Constitution of Medina, defining rights for Muslims, Jews, and pagans. This effectively created a state with the power to coerce.
-- Debate on Intent: Scholars (e.g., Poston Larry) debate if Muhammad intended a world religion or a "succinctly Arab brand of monotheism," citing Quranic references to an "Arabic book."
-- Consolidation: Conquered Mecca (629 CE). Tribal chiefs across Arabia agreed to pay the alms levy to his government, which consisted of deputies, an army, and a public treasury.

3. The Rashidun Caliphate (632–661 CE)

- Abu Bakr (632–634):
-- Role: First Caliph ("Successor"). Retained religious authority but laid no claim to prophecy.
-- Ridda Wars: Defeated tribes that ceased alms payments or claimed new prophets. Momentum from these wars carried armies into Byzantine/Sassanid lands.

- Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (634–644):
-- Austerity: Lived in a mud hut without doors; walked streets at night to consult the poor.
-- Welfare State (Bayt al-mal): Established a treasury assisting Muslim and non-Muslim poor, elderly, orphans, and disabled. Introduced child benefits and pensions.
-- Administration: Removed governors attracted to wealth. Ordered irrigation network improvements. Founded garrison cities (Basra, Kufa, Fustat) to keep troops away from "luxury."
-- Conquest: Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Persia incorporated. Expansion halted briefly (638–639) due to famine/plague.

- Uthmān ibn ʿAffān (644–656):
-- Quran Compilation: Ordered a standard copy (c. 650–656) to fix phonetic variations caused by dialects.
-- Naval Power: Governor Muawiyah established the first navy (crewed by Coptic/Jacobite Christians), defeating Byzantines at Battle of the Masts (655), opening the Mediterranean.
-- Tensions: Old tribal differences resurfaced (Iraq vs. Syria). Marwan I (his secretary) manipulated control. Uthman assassinated by rebels.

- Ali ibn Abi Talib (656–661):
-- First Fitna: Civil war triggered by Marwan I's manipulation and demands to punish Uthman's killers.
-- Battles: Battle of the Camel (vs. Aisha), Battle of Siffin (vs. Muawiyah).
-- Kharijites: Former allies who turned on Ali for accepting arbitration; assassinated him in 661.
-- Hasan's Abdication: Ali's son Hasan signed a peace treaty with Muawiyah, handing over power on the condition Muawiyah would rule justly and not establish a dynasty.

4. The Umayyad Caliphate (661–750)

- Muawiyah I:
-- Moved capital to Damascus. Developed a court rivaling Constantinople.
-- Controversy: Sunnis credit him with saving the nation from anarchy; Shias accuse him of fabricating heresies, slandering the Prophet's family, and selling critics into slavery.
-- Succession: Violated the treaty with Hasan by appointing his son Yazid, establishing a dynasty.

- Second Fitna:
-- Karbala (680): Yazid I’s forces killed Husayn ibn Ali.
-- Abd al-Malik: Consolidated rule. Made Arabic the state language. Minted the first independent Islamic currency, leading to a war with Byzantine Emperor Justinian II (Battle of Sebastopolis, 692).

- Expansion & Decline:
-- Al-Walid I: Empire reached maximum extent (Spain to India). Built the strongest navy.
-- The Berber Revolt: Uqba ibn Nafi marched to the Atlantic but was ambushed and killed at Biskra. Berbers drove Muslims out of North Africa temporarily.
-- Siege of Constantinople (717): Massive failure under Sulayman; decisive intervention by Bulgarians led to heavy Muslim losses.
-- Internal Rot: Walid II deposed for "immorality" (discrimination against Yemenis). Marwan II was the last Umayyad ruler in Damascus.

- The Fall: The Abbasid Revolution (750), led by Abu Muslim, rallied Mawali (non-Arab converts) and Shias. The Umayyad family was massacred; Abd al-Rahman I escaped to Spain, sending Abbasid heads back in salt packages.

5. The Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258)

- Early Abbasids (Golden Age):
-- Shift: Capital moved to Baghdad. Shifted focus to the East (Persia/Transoxania).
-- Al-Mansur & Al-Mahdi: Population of Muslims doubled (8% to 15%) as Jizya collection was de-emphasized. Baghdad became the world's largest city.
-- Harun al-Rashid: Established Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom). Period of "Muslim Agricultural Revolution" and "Scientific Revolution."
-- Al-Ma'mun: Centralized power. Sponsored the Mu'tazila (rationalists). Launched the Mihna (Inquisition) in 833. Breached the Great Pyramid of Giza searching for knowledge.

- Anarchy at Samarra:
-- Al-Mu'tasim: Created a new capital at Samarra. Relied on Turkish slave-soldiers (Ghilman) due to distrust of Arabs/Persians.
-- Regicide: The Turks assassinated Al-Mutawakkil, then Al-Muntasir, then Al-Musta'in, then Al-Mu'tazz. The Caliphate became a puppet institution.
-- Zanj Rebellion: Massive slave revolt that weakened the state.

- The "Shadow" Caliphate:
-- Buyids (945–1055): Persian Shias who conquered Baghdad, ruling as Sultans while keeping Abbasid Caliphs as figureheads.
-- Seljuks (1055–1194): Sunni Turks who replaced the Buyids. Alp Arslan supported the Nezamiyeh universities to revive Sunnism.
-- Late Revival: Caliphs like Al-Muqtafi and An-Nasir briefly regained military control in Iraq.
-- The End: Mongol invasion (1258). Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad. A powerless "Shadow Caliph" was installed in Cairo under the Mamluks until 1517.

6. Regional Dynasties & The Crusades

- Fatimid Caliphate (Tunisia/Egypt):
-- Ismaili Shia: Founded by Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah (909). Claimed descent from Fatima.

-- Conversion: The Ilkhanate, Golden Horde, and Chagatai Khanate converted. Mediated by Sufi mystics (dervishes), not orthodox scholars.

-- Berber Interventions: The Almoravids (11th C) and Almohads (12th C) invaded from Africa to save Muslim Spain but imposed strict religious rule.
-- Reconquista: Gradual Christian advance. Fall of Granada (1492) ended Muslim rule.
