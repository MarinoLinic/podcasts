Nathan Cofnas on Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy

Summary: 
A rigorous academic critique of Kevin MacDonald’s trilogy, specifically *The Culture of Critique*. Cofnas argues that MacDonald’s theory—that Judaism is a group evolutionary strategy designed to undermine Gentile society—relies on systematically misrepresented sources, the omission of key counter-evidence (e.g., anti-Zionist Jews), and unfalsifiable circular logic. Cofnas proposes the "Default Hypothesis" (High IQ + Urban Geography) as a superior, parsimonious explanation for Jewish overrepresentation in *both* Liberal and Conservative movements.

1. The Core Dispute: MacDonald’s Theory vs. The Default Hypothesis

1.1. MacDonald’s "Group Evolutionary Strategy"

- The Trilogy: *A People That Shall Dwell Alone* (1994), *Separation and Its Discontents* (1998), *The Culture of Critique* (1998).

- The Biological Premise: Jews have evolved genetic adaptations for:
-- High Intelligence: (Mean IQ ~117 according to MacDonald).
-- Conscientiousness: High impulse control.
-- Ethnocentrism: Hyper-collectivism.

- The Cultural/Political Premise: Post-Enlightenment Jews created secular intellectual movements (Boasian Anthropology, Freudianism, Frankfurt School, Marxism) that function as "Jewish strategies."
-- Structure: These movements mimic religious Judaism (charismatic authoritarian leaders, dogmatic text analysis, rejection of empirical data).
-- Goal: To fragment Gentile society (promote individualism/multiculturalism) and preserve Jewish continuity (promote collectivism/Zionism), thereby reducing Anti-Semitism via "divide and conquer."

1.2. Why Engage with this Theory?

- Academic Endorsement: It has received praise from figures like H.J. Eysenck and David Sloan Wilson, giving it a veneer of scientific credibility.

- The "Alt-Right" Touchstone: MacDonald is described by the *NYT* and Richard Spencer as the "Marx of the Anti-Semites." His work is the foundational text for modern white nationalism.

- The Danger of Silence: Ignoring MacDonald has allowed his followers to claim he is "unrefuted."

1.3. The "Default Hypothesis" (Cofnas’s Alternative)

- The Variables:
    1.  IQ: Ashkenazi mean IQ is ~110 (with significantly higher Verbal IQ).
    2.  Geography: Jews have been historically concentrated in major urban intellectual hubs (Vienna, Berlin, New York, Paris).

- The Prediction: Jews will be vastly overrepresented in *any* cognitively demanding activity (Science, Law, Politics, Arts) that does not explicitly exclude them (i.e., overtly anti-Semitic movements).

- The Evidence:
-- Non-Political Dominance: Jews are 31% of Chemistry Nobelists, 37% of Physics Nobelists, and 50% of World Chess Champions. (MacDonald cannot explain this via "political strategy").
-- Political Spectrum: Jews are overrepresented in Liberalism, but *also* in Conservatism, Libertarianism, and Objectivism, provided the movements aren't anti-Semitic.

2. General Methodological Failures in *The Culture of Critique*

2.1. The "Double Standard" Heuristic

- MacDonald interprets the exact same behavior differently based on the ethnicity of the actor:
-- Jewish Radicals: Proof of a "War on Gentile Culture."
-- Gentile Radicals (e.g., John Dewey, Carl Jung): Labeled as "shills," "dupes," or "window dressing" recruited to hide Jewish dominance.
-- Jewish Conservatives (e.g., Richard Herrnstein): Their support for meritocracy is spun as a strategy to allow smart Jews to rise.
-- Gentile Conservatives (e.g., Charles Murray): Their support for meritocracy is interpreted as naive altruism or a desire for social harmony.

- Conclusion: The theory is rigged. Every outcome confirms Jewish ethnocentrism.

2.2. The Logic of "Hypocrisy"

- MacDonald defines Jewish hypocrisy as "Jews supporting open borders for the US but closed borders for Israel."

- The Flaw: He treats "The Jews" as a monolith.
-- Liberal Jews: Generally support multiculturalism/openness in *both* the US and Israel (e.g., Dershowitz, Reform Judaism).
-- Orthodox/Conservative Jews: Generally support nationalism/borders in *both* the US and Israel.

- No Contradiction: Finding *different* Jews who hold opposing views is not evidence of group hypocrisy; it is evidence of internal political diversity.

3. Case Study: Boasian Anthropology

3.1. The Charge
MacDonald claims Franz Boas and his Jewish students created "Romantic Primitivism" to attack Western Civilization as repressive and to promote environmentalism (denying racial differences) to weaken white solidarity.

3.2. The Rebuttal

- Rousseau’s Legacy: The concept of the "Noble Savage" and the critique of Western Civilization predates Boas by 150 years. It originates with Jean-Jacques Rousseau (a Gentile). It is a Western, not Jewish, tradition.

- Gentile Leadership: The most famous and effective Boasians were Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict (Gentiles).
-- MacDonald claims they were "puppets" of Boas.
-- Cofnas argues they were charismatic, independent iconoclasts. There is no evidence Boas controlled them.

- The Immigration Context:
-- Boasians opposed the "Nordic Superiority" theory (Madison Grant).
-- *Effect:* By denying Nordic superiority, Boasians argued that Italians, Poles, and Greeks were equal to Anglo-Saxons. This effectively promoted White Unity, contradicting MacDonald's claim that they sought to fragment whites.

3.3. The Hereditarian Counter-Example

- MacDonald claims Jews tabooed the study of race differences.

- The Reality: Jews are massively overrepresented among the most prominent Hereditarians (Race Realists).
-- The List: Hans Eysenck (Jewish mother), Richard Herrnstein (Jewish), Steven Pinker (Jewish), Arthur Jensen (1/4 Jewish).
-- The Ratio: 2 out of 7 of the most famous hereditarians were Jewish—a massive overrepresentation relative to the population.
-- *MacDonald’s Spin:* He attempts to paint Herrnstein as acting in ethnic interests (meritocracy favors Jews) while painting co-author Charles Murray as an altruistic Gentile. This is purely subjective.

4. Case Study: Freud and the "New York Intellectuals"

4.1. The Charge
MacDonald claims Freud saw himself as a leader in a "war on Gentile culture" and that the "New York Intellectuals" (mostly Jewish) used Freudianism to destroy Western family structures.

4.2. Analyzing the "Top 21 Intellectuals"
MacDonald cites Kadushin’s (1974) list of the top 21 US intellectuals (15 were Jewish) as proof of the conspiracy. Cofnas analyzes the specific Jews on this list, finding they refute the theory:
1.  Noam Chomsky: The world's leading critic of Israel. MacDonald dismisses him in a footnote as "uninfluenced by Jewish identity."
2.  Hannah Arendt: Had a romantic relationship with Nazi philosopher Martin Heidegger; defended Adolf Eichmann; opposed Jewish nationalism.
3.  Herbert Marcuse: Advocated for the return of Arab refugees to Israel to *end* the Jewish majority. (MacDonald falsely implies Marcuse wanted a Jewish ethnostate).
4.  Saul Bellow: A staunch conservative who urged Allan Bloom to write *The Closing of the American Mind* (a defense of the Western Canon).
5.  Robert Silvers: Editor of *NYRB*, which published critiques of psychoanalysis (contradicting the claim that Jewish media protected Freud).
6.  Norman Mailer: Sympathized with Palestinians.

Conclusion: Of the 15 Jews cited *by MacDonald*, almost none fit his profile of the "Jewish Ethnic Warrior." Many were anti-Zionist or Conservative.

4.3. Freud’s "Fanaticism"

- The 1929 Incident: After the Hebron massacre (Arabs killed Jews), Freud was asked to sign a petition condemning the Arabs.

- Freud's Response: He refused, stating: "I concede with sorrow that the unrealistic fanaticism of our people is in part to be blamed for the awakening of Arab distrust."

- Analysis: This directly contradicts MacDonald's caricature of Freud as a monomaniacal apologist for Jewry who pathologizes all Gentile reaction.

5. Case Study: The Frankfurt School & Authoritarian Personality

5.1. The Charge
MacDonald claims the Frankfurt School (Adorno, Horkheimer) created *The Authoritarian Personality* to pathologize Gentile group allegiance (labeling it mental illness) while hypocritically retaining Jewish group allegiance.

5.2. Misrepresentation of Sources (R. Nevitt Sanford)

- MacDonald quotes R. Nevitt Sanford (a Gentile author of the book) as proof that the text attacks Christianity.

- The Distortion: MacDonald claims Sanford links religion to "conformity and authoritarian submission."

- The Reality: In the full text, Sanford explicitly distinguishes between "nominal" religion (based on submission) and "genuine" Christianity (based on internalized values). Sanford writes that "genuine" Christians score *low* on ethnocentrism. The text actually praises Christian humanism.

5.3. No Evidence of Double Standard

- MacDonald claims the book implies Jewish nationalism is "healthy" while Gentile nationalism is "sick."

- Fact Check: The book *never mentions* Jewish nationalism. MacDonald hallucinates a double standard based on his assumption of the authors' secret motives.

- Fromm & Marcuse: Key Frankfurt School figures openly argued *against* Jewish nationalism. Erich Fromm wrote: "The claim of the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a realistic political claim."

6. Case Study: Communism and The Left

6.1. The "Jewish Bolshevism" Trope

- MacDonald argues Jewish overrepresentation in Bolshevism was an expression of Jewish estrangement from Gentile culture and a desire to destroy it.

- Pipes’s Counter-Argument: Historian Richard Pipes argued Jewish representation was simply due to high literacy and urbanization (The Default Hypothesis). MacDonald dismisses this, arguing that "de-ethnicized" Jews were secretly still ethnocentric.

6.2. The Problem of Karl Marx

- Marx is the ultimate Jewish radical.

- Marx’s Views: He was violently anti-Semitic. He wrote *On the Jewish Question*, equating Judaism with "huckstering" and money, calling for the abolition of the Jew.

- MacDonald’s Handling: He ignores Marx almost entirely. He cannot explain how the founder of the "Jewish Strategy" was an anti-Semite who wanted Judaism to vanish.

6.3. The Polish Security Service

- MacDonald claims Jewish communists in Poland used the Security Service to persecute Gentiles out of "ethnic revenge."

- The Missing Data: Cofnas cites Schatz (1991): 40% of the victims of the secret police were Jewish.

- Analysis: Since Jews were <1% of the Polish population but 40% of the purge victims, the "ethnic revenge" theory collapses. It was an intra-party ideological purge, not an ethnic war.

7. Contemporary Evidence & The "Brick Wall"

7.1. Immigration Hypocrisy?

- MacDonald claims Jews want a white-minority America but a pure Jewish Israel.

- Ethiopian Jews: Prominent Liberal Jews (like Alan Dershowitz) spent decades pressuring Israel to accept Ethiopian Jews (who are racially distinct from Ashkenazim). This proves they support multiculturalism in *both* places.

- Intermarriage: Reform Jews (the "Liberals" MacDonald fears) have intermarriage rates of ~50-70%. They are actively dissolving the "Jewish Gene Pool," not preserving it.

7.2. Jewish Opposition to Wokism

- MacDonald admits in *Culture of Critique* that "many of the most prominent opponents of multiculturalism are Jewish neoconservatives."

- The Pivot: He claims this opposition is *also* a Jewish strategy (to prevent anti-Semitism caused by too much liberalism).

- The Trap: If Jews support Liberalism, it's a strategy. If Jews oppose Liberalism, it's a strategy. The theory is unfalsifiable.

7.3. Modern Examples supporting Default Hypothesis

- Jonathan Haidt: Leading critic of liberal bias in academia (Jewish).

- Steven Pinker: Leading advocate for Darwinism/Bio-truth (Jewish).

- FIRE: Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, defending conservative speech on campus (Founders Kors & Silverglate are Jewish).

- American Renaissance: The leading "highbrow" white nationalist conference. 4 of the 10 speakers at its first conference were Jewish.

8. Conclusion

- Systematic Dishonesty: MacDonald’s work is characterized by the omission of counter-examples (Marx, Chomsky), the distortion of texts (Sanford, Freud), and circular reasoning.

- Evolutionary Psychology: Valid evolutionary psychology (e.g., Pinker, Tooby) relies on data, not conspiracy. MacDonald does not represent the field.

- Final Verdict: The Default Hypothesis (IQ + Cities) explains the data perfectly. Jews are overrepresented in *all* intellectual movements—Marxism, Libertarianism, Neoconservatism, Physics, and Chess—because they are a high-IQ, urban population. No "Group Strategy" is required.
