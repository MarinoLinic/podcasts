Nathan Cofnas on Beating Woke with Facts and Logic

Summary: 
An argument that "wokism" (race communism) is built on a false empirical premise (the equality thesis) and can only be defeated by exposing this premise as false via a "hereditarian revolution." The essay counters critics (like Chris Rufo) who argue that ideology is immune to facts, demonstrating through history (Darwinism, Heliocentrism) and cognitive science that elites do change their minds when presented with overwhelming evidence. It predicts that once the "equality thesis" falls, wokism will collapse rather than mutate into "hereditarian race communism."

1. The Core Syllogism of Wokism

- The Structure: Wokism is not random; it follows a logical path based on three components:
    1.  Empirical Premise (Equality Thesis): All races/sexes have the same innate distribution of traits.
    2.  Moral Premise: All people have a right to achieve their potential.
    3.  Conclusion: Persistence of disparities = Moral Emergency (Proof of systemic racism/sexism).

- The Flaw: The Empirical Premise is objectively false. Disparities are rooted in natural differences (heredity).

- The Strategy: Wokism spirals into a futile war against "environmental ghosts" (phantom racism). The only way to stop it is to falsify the Empirical Premise. If the premise is false, the conclusion (moral emergency) collapses.

2. The Rufo Critique: "Pokémon Cards vs. Tanks"

- The Criticism: Critics like Christopher Rufo argue that wokesters are immune to facts. They claim:
    1.  Ideologues don't change minds; they just call you racist.
    2.  "Win the battle of ideas" is like bringing Pokémon cards to a tank fight. Institutions run on power, not logic.

- The Rebuttal:
-- Tanks require Commanders: You cannot just "blow up" the institutions because the human capital running them (scientists, lawyers, bureaucrats) is the woke left. You need them to defect, or you cannot govern.
-- Proximate vs. Ultimate Cause: Power (tanks) is the proximate cause of victory, but ideas determine who drives the tanks. Wokism won because it convinced the elites, not because it started with the tanks.

- The "Brick Wall" of Anti-Woke:
-- Rufo’s own "counter-elite" strategy is failing. The Logos Fellowship collapsed (one fellow became a literal Nazi/Groyper).
-- The Talent Deficit: The Right lacks the human capital to staff institutions. Examples: Trump’s FEMA head didn’t know about hurricane season; HHS Secretary RFK Jr. is an anti-vaxxer raw-milk enthusiast with brain worms.
-- Conclusion: You cannot "purge" your way to competence if 99% of competent people are woke. You must convert them.

3. The Mechanics of Belief Formation

- Evolutionary Basis: Beliefs are selected for adaptiveness, not truth.
-- Example: Believing "God hates birth control" is false but adaptive (increases reproduction).

- The Two Heuristics:
    1.  Conformity: "Man is a herd animal." If the tribe avoids red berries, you should too.
    2.  Copy the Successful: If Ug the Hunter uses feathers on arrows, you copy him.

- Neuroplasticity & The "Sensitive Period":
-- Childhood Imprinting: Germans born in the 1930s (Nazi education) remained more anti-Semitic for life than those born in the 1910s.
-- The Tipping Point: Beliefs are stubborn but do change (e.g., Gay Marriage support flipped from 35% to 71% in two decades).
-- The 51% Rule: Once a belief hits ~51%, conformity reverses polarity. The herd stampedes toward the new orthodoxy.

4. Do Elites Change Their Minds? (Historical Case Studies)

- Thesis: Smart people (Cognitive Elites) are the first to change their minds because they have higher neuroplasticity and logical processing power.
-- Heliocentrism: Initially offensive to religion/man’s ego. Won via facts and logic. Now, even if 26% of Americans think the Sun goes around the Earth, the elites don't, so planes still fly.
-- Darwinism: T.H. Huxley vs. Bishop Wilberforce. The Church fought it, but the elites defected to Darwin. Today, creationism has zero cultural power despite 37% of the public believing it.
-- Communism: Post-WWII, elites loved central planning (Einstein, Orwell). When it failed empirically, elites abandoned it for regulated markets/neoliberalism. Only low-IQ fringe leftists remain actual communists.

5. The History of Race Denial (Liberalism vs. Reality)

- The Blank Slate Tradition:
-- John Locke: "White paper, void of all characters." Asserted a Hottentot could be a mathematician in England. Based on zero evidence.
-- J.S. Mill / John B. Watson: "Give me a dozen healthy infants..." (Behaviorism). Watson admitted he was "going beyond his facts," but did so because the alternative was morally unpalatable.

- The Shift:
-- UNESCO 1950/1951: Post-WWII, the UN issued statements declaring race differences in intelligence to be nonexistent.
-- The Scientist Revolt: Leading geneticists (Fisher, Mayr, Darlington) objected, calling the statement "political propaganda" and "exceedingly weak." But the "Noble Lie" prevailed to prevent another Holocaust.

6. Breaking the Taboo: Why Hereditarianism Can Win

- The Current Trap: The taboo is maintained by:
    1.  Conformity: Everyone claims to believe the Equality Thesis.
    2.  Virtue Signaling: Distancing oneself from Hitler.
    3.  Ethics: The belief that "science must support brotherhood."

- The Hereditarian Aces:
    1.  It is True: Every environmental theory for the race IQ gap has failed (Head Start, No Child Left Behind).
    2.  Failure Has Consequences: Policies based on the Equality Thesis (wars to democratize the Middle East, domestic education reform) cost trillions and achieve nothing. The "Noble Lie" is expensive.

- Refuting Rufo's Pessimism:
-- Rufo claims hereditarianism has been argued "for decades in prestigious places."
-- Counter-Fact: The Bell Curve authors were "resolutely agnostic" on genes. Nixon/Moynihan agreed privately to never talk about it. There has never been a concerted, public elite campaign for hereditarianism.

7. The Myth of "Hereditarian Race Communism"

- The Fear: Right-wing critics (BAP, Hunter Ash) argue that if leftists accept hereditarianism, they will just demand more redistribution to compensate for "genetic bad luck" (The Kathryn Paige Harden / Freddie deBoer position).

- Why This is a Unicorn:
-- No Audience: Harden and deBoer are despised by the Left for even hinting at genes. They are not leaders; they are pariahs.
-- Rationality of Elites: History shows elites do abandon ideologies when the empirical premise rots (e.g., the shift from Communism to Neoliberalism).
-- Moral High Ground: Wokism relies on the "Moral Emergency" of unfair treatment. If the disparity is nature's fault, the "Emergency" dissolves.
-- The Post-Hereditarian Landscape: Even if some "Hereditarian Leftism" emerges (e.g., genetic engineering/eugenics), it is preferable to Wokism because it is grounded in reality. It ends the "Grievance Industrial Complex" of blaming whites for phantom racism.

8. Conclusion: The Only Way Out

- The Ultimate Argument: The Right has been on the defensive for generations because it cannot rebut the moral claim: "Groups are equal, outcomes are not, therefore you are racist."

- The Pivot: Acknowledging that "some inequality is built into nature" destroys the moral leverage of the Left. It allows for a politics of "making peace with reality" rather than a permanent crusade against it.
