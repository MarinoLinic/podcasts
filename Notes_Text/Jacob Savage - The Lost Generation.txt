Jacob Savage on The Lost Generation

Summary:
Jacob Savage argues that white male millennials (born roughly 1981–1996) faced a unique "professional guillotine" around 2014 due to the institutionalization of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). Unlike Boomers and Gen X, who were already established, or Gen Z, who self-selected out of these fields, millennial white men were blindsided by a sudden shift from meritocracy to identity-based hiring. Through extensive data and interviews across media, academia, Hollywood, and corporate America, Savage illustrates how this cohort became a "lost generation," squeezed out by older white male gatekeepers who pulled the ladder up behind them to satisfy diversity mandates. The article posits that this was not a "gentle rebalancing" but a hard exclusion that fundamentally altered the life trajectories of thousands of men.

1. The Personal & The Universal: The 2016 Failure

- The Author's Story:
-- The Setup: In Jan 2016, Savage (31 years old) and his writing partner had a pilot script loved by an executive. A veteran showrunner agreed to "come on" to the project.
-- The Rejection: The showrunner emailed apologetically that he couldn't hire them for the room.
-- The Meeting: Savage met the executive anyway. The executive (a Gen-X white guy) explicitly stated the room was small, the higher-level writers were all white men, and they "couldn't have an all-white-male room."
-- The Room Itself: Savage visited the room. It contained three older white men (the "Lifers") and two young women. The older men were debating a "Time Machine Paradox" (whether switching time machines in the future creates a paradox).
-- The "Lifers" Resume: The older white men had "IMDb bios from an alternate universe"—careers built on mediocre shows like Martial Law, FreakyLinks, Roswell, John Doe, and LAX. They were allowed to be average; Savage was not.
-- The Result: That meeting was the closest Savage ever got. He spent the next 15 years scalping tickets to pay bills.

- The Statistical Cliff (The "Hinge" Year: 2014):
-- TV Writers: In 2011, white men were 48% of lower-level TV writers. By 2024, they were 11.9%.
-- Journalism (The Atlantic): In 2013, staff was 53% male / 89% white. By 2024, 36% male / 66% white.
-- Harvard Humanities: White men fell from 39% of tenure-track positions in 2014 to 18% in 2023.
-- The "Chainsaw" vs. "Benign" Narrative: While the Trump administration (2025) attacks DEI, and liberals like Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor defend it as "benign" or "ineffectual," Savage argues for the millennial male it was a "profound shift in how power and prestige were distributed."

2. Sector Deep Dive: Media & Journalism

- The Pre-2014 Optimism:
-- Critics in 2014 (NPR, Nate Silver) argued New Media (Vox, BuzzFeed, Politico) was too white/male. Silver noted only 15% of FiveThirtyEight applicants were women.
-- Gawker (57% male/79% white) and Vice (majority male/70% white) were still dominated by the "misfit young white man" archetype.

- The Shift (Andrew's Story):
-- Profile: Andrew, a left-leaning reporter, joined a New Media org in 2015. Initially successful with deep dives and scoops.
-- The 2019 Pivot: David Haskell (EIC of New York Mag) publicly apologized for being "another white man" and promised to use his power to "move the needle."
-- The "No Backsliding" Rule: If a woman or POC left a role, the replacement must be a woman or POC.
-- The "Superstar" Trap: A hiring editor noted that while they could find a "black woman at the beginning of her career," if she was any good, she would immediately be poached by the NYT or WaPo. White men, however, had to be generational talents to be considered.

- The 2020 Acceleration (George Floyd):
-- New Pledges: NYT promised "sweeping reforms"; WaPo aimed to be the "most diverse newsroom"; Bon Appétit confessed to "tokenizing" BIPOC staff; NPR called diversity its "North Star."
-- Hiring Stats (2021):
-- Condé Nast: New hires 25% male / 49% white.
-- California Times (LA Times): New hires 39% male / 31% white.
-- ProPublica: 66% women / 58% POC.
-- NPR: 78% of new hires were POC.
-- The "Exclusion" Talk: A hiring editor admitted, "It was a given that we weren’t gonna hire the best person… It was jarring how we would talk about excluding white guys." White men were ~50% of applicants but filled ~10% of roles.

- The Culture of the Newsroom:
-- Union Radicalization: Andrew’s union shifted from standard labor issues (pay/severance) to demanding racial quotas and "emergency hires of black people."
-- Zoom Dynamics: Andrew described a culture where "women would clap back" and others would "snap their fingers in the chat window," creating a hostile subcultural language.
-- Performative Allyship: A prominent Gen-X reporter noted that remaining white men adopted "protective coloration"—hyper-progressive allyship—to survive. Andrew noted he couldn't fake this: "There wasn’t much room for people who even speak in my timbre."

- The Pipeline Collapse:
-- The Atlantic: Jeffrey Goldberg (EIC) admitted in 2019 that while white men write the "10,000-word cover stories," he was "imagining their rise" differently to open leadership to others.
-- Result: Since 2020, 2/3rds of hires were women; in 2024, 75% of hires were women.
-- NYT Magazine: Leadership is Gen-X white men (Jake Silverstein, Bill Wasik). Below them? Of 9 millennial senior editors, only 1 is a white man (hired in 2012, grandfathered in).
-- Internships:
-- LA Times: Since 2020, only 7.7% of interns were white men.
-- WaPo: 2018–2024, only 2-3 white men per year (out of ~30). In 2025, coincidental with political shifts, this number jumped back to 7.
-- NYT Fellowship: Only 10% of nearly 220 fellows since 2018 have been white men.

- The "Vox" Bellwether:
-- 2013: Vox Media was 82% male / 88% white.
-- 2022: 37% male / 59% white.
-- 2025: Leadership is 73% female.

3. Sector Deep Dive: Academia

- The "David Austin Walsh" Case:
-- Walsh (Yale Postdoc) tweeted: "I’m 35… 4+ years post-PhD… I’m also a white dude… I’m for all intents and purposes unemployable."
-- Reaction: Mockery from elites (Nikole Hannah-Jones) and tenured professors ("You are all just laughable"), despite data confirming his claim.

- The Demographic Logjam:
-- The 1994 Law: Congress ended the academic exemption for age discrimination. Boomers refused to retire.
-- Harvard Arts & Sciences: 55% white male faculty (legacy), but the pipeline is drying up.
-- Yale History Dept:
-- Boomers: 10 white male professors over age 70.
-- Millennials: 16 tenured/tenure-track professors. Only 1 is a white man.
-- Cold War Historian John Gaddis (84): Admitted "remedial action was long overdue."

- The Mechanisms of Exclusion:
-- The "Foreign Loophole": European white men do not count as "white" in IPEDS federal data (they are "Non-Resident Aliens"). They also exist outside the US culture war.
-- Stat: Among new PhDs, white visa holders are twice as likely (61% vs 33%) to get tenure-track jobs compared to white US citizens.
-- Cluster Hiring: Used to bypass tenure review. Hiring for "Latinx Studies" or "Transgender Studies" guarantees non-white/non-male hires without explicit bans.
-- The Invisible Curriculum: James (Classics) anecdote about a student interested in "Roman military history." This topic is coded as "white/European/male/dead." The student who did get hired was "Gay, Asian-American, exceptionally conversant in critical theory."

- Case Study: "Ethan" (Social Science):
-- The Expectation: Entered academia to fight inequality, believing in the Obama-era "arc of history."
-- Brown University (The "Locke" Era):
-- Provost Richard Locke (Gen-X white man) pledged to double diversity.
-- The Funnel (Humanities 2022):
-- Applicants: 55% Male.
-- Long List: 48% Male.
-- Short List: 42% Male.
-- Interviews: 34% Male.
-- Offers: 29% Male.
-- Result: Since 2022, Brown hired 45 tenure-track professors in humanities/social sciences. Only 3 (6.7%) were white American men.
-- The UC System (California):
-- AFD Program: $8.5 million state program used DEI statements as a "first cut" to eliminate candidates before research was even reviewed.
-- Berkeley: White male hires dropped from 52.7% (2015) to 21.5% (2023).
-- UC Irvine: Since 2020, hired 64 professors. 3 were white men (4.7%).
-- UC Santa Cruz: 2020–2024, 2 white men out of 59 hires (3%).
-- Ethan's Outcome: Applied to 50 jobs, finalist 5 times. Rejected for not centering race. Remains in a "dead end," delaying children with his partner due to lack of tenure security.

4. Sector Deep Dive: Hollywood ("Peak TV")

- The Whistleblower Evidence:
-- The "Needs Sheet" (2017): An internal talent agency grid tracking staffing needs.
-- The Mandates:
-- Noah Hawley: "Prioritizing women."
-- Dean Devlin: "Ideally hire ethnic/African American."
-- Ryan Murphy: "Want female and diverse, emphasis on African American."
-- Chicago Fire: "UL [Upper Level] can be [anyone], but we need diverse SWs [Staff Writers]."

- Institutional Barriers:
-- Fellowships:
-- Disney Writing Program: 107 fellows in a decade. 0 white men. Bios emphasize identity ("Cuban, Puerto Rican, and New Mexican roots").
-- Sundance Lab: White male participation dropped from 27.5% of applicants (2016) to 5.8% of fellows (post-2018). The few white men accepted usually had another marker (disabled, gay) or a diverse writing partner.

- Case Study: "Matt" (Screenwriter):
-- Trajectory: Moved to LA in 2011. Landed a network TV job in 2014. Earned a huge paycheck. Thought he was set.
-- The Wall: 2015 post-#OscarsSoWhite. Suddenly couldn't get a meeting.
-- The Black List: Wrote a script that made the "Black List" (top unproduced scripts). Got A-list showrunners attached. Still couldn't get staffed on his own show.
-- The 2020 Block: Agent submitted him for a prestige series. Showrunners liked the script. Offer pulled by a Gen-X white showrunner because "the room already has too many white guys."
-- Current Status: Works menial day job. Deep debt. Fantasizes about moving to Thailand to escape creditors ("Sweet one-bedroom, VPN... The Dream").

- The Generational Divide (Oscars):
-- 2004–2013: 40+ Gen-X white men nominated for Screenwriting Oscars.
-- 2014–2023: 50+ Gen-X white men nominated.
-- Millennials: Only 6 white male millennials nominated in the last decade.

- Directing Stats:
-- 2014: White men directed 69% of TV episodes.
-- 2021: White men directed 34%.
-- Emmys: Since 2021, 11 directors under 40 nominated. 0 white men.

5. The Myth of the "Pivot" (Corporate, Med, Tech)

- The "Prestige" Drain:
-- MacArthur "Genius" Grants: In 2013 alone, 7 Gen-X white men won. That is the same number as all millennial white men who have won since.
-- National Book Awards: 2014 had 2 white male millennial finalists. In the decade since, out of 70 nominees, only 3 were white men.
-- Art World:
-- "Big 4" Galleries represent 47 millennial artists; only 3 are white men.
-- Whitney Biennial 2024: 45 millennial artists, 0 white American men.

- No Safe Harbor:
-- Medicine: White men dropped from 31% of med students (2014) to 20.5% (2025). A millennial oncologist noted that at every stage (residency, fellowship), the white man is the "token" to be discarded.
-- Law: White men matriculants dropped from 31.2% (2016) to 25.7% (2024).
-- Tech (Google): White male workforce dropped from ~50% (2014) to <30% (2024).
-- Tech (Amazon):
-- 2014 Entry Level: 42.3% White Male.
-- 2024 Mid-Level (The Cohort Outcome): 33.8% White Male. A massive attrition rate of nearly 40%.

- The "Alternative" Economies:
-- Young white men flocked to Crypto, Podcasting, and Substack.
-- Reason: Not because these fields were high-status, but because they had no HR departments to enforce the blockade. A film editor friend applied to Netflix 5 times, was rejected for being white, and pivoted to crypto out of necessity, not desire.

6. Conclusion: The "Lost" Psychology

- The "Mediocrity" Argument:
-- Liberals argue that only "mediocre" white men were hurt.
-- Savage counters: In "ordinary times," ordinary talent was enough for a middle-class life. The new system requires white men to be exceptional to survive, while allowing mediocrity for everyone else (including the older white men who implemented the system).

- Political Consequences:
-- The "Josh Hawley Path": Many thriving white millennial men have had to "leave liberal America" to succeed.
-- The Betrayal: Millennial men were "true believers" in the Obama-era meritocracy. The realization that "the world is not rooting for you—in fact, it’s deliberately rooting against you" has created deep cynicism and resentment toward the liberal project.

- Final Reflection:
-- Savage admits to "wounded pride." He wanted to take his two sons to film sets. Instead, he sits in his bedroom scrolling spreadsheets.
-- He acknowledges the women who got the jobs didn't "take" them; the system was rigged by the older generation. (Marino's remark: _He's still buying into the very ideological system that did this to him. It's not just boomers—it's everything he believes about the world, and everyone who participates is COMPLICIT._)
-- The psychological safety of the "Lost Generation": It is less painful to believe the game was rigged (which data suggests it was) than to believe they simply failed on the merits.
