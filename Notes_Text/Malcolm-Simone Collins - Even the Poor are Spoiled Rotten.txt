Interview Notes: Malcolm-Simone Collins on Even the Poor are Spoiled Rotten

*

I. Introduction: The "Uncool" Message

- The Core Thesis: The algorithm hates this message, but it is necessary: You should feel incredibly privileged to be alive today.
-- Current narratives focus on the negatives: "Dating is impossible," "I can't get a job," "I'll never own a home."
-- While these struggles are real, they overshadow the baseline reality of modern existence.

- The Shift in Rights: Society has shifted from the Jeffersonian "Pursuit of Happiness" (potentially fruitless) to an entitlement belief that one has a right to happiness merely for existing.

II. The Miracle of Modern Abundance (The Walmart Test)

- The "People of Walmart":
-- Simone references a VTuber who refused to go back to Walmart because it was "disgusting," and the old blog "People of Walmart" which mocked poor Americans.
-- The *Wall-E* Comparison: Critics look at overweight people on scooters and see disgust; Malcolm sees the background—they are on an AI-powered spaceship with unlimited calories.
-- Simone’s Perspective: Despite being sensitive/autistic, Simone views Walmart as a museum of "obscene luxury."

- The Labor-to-Calorie Ratio:
-- In the US, 2-3 hours of minimum wage labor can be traded for reliable, safe calories in 1,000 different flavors.
-- Hunter-Gatherer Contrast: If you told an ancestor they could get food without guessing if the berries would kill them or if the meat had gone bad, they would be astounded.

- Modern Tools: We have apps (like the "Food or Poison" TikTok lady) that identify plants instantly; ancestors died trial-and-erroring this knowledge.

III. The Extreme Evolution of Food

- Genetic Modification (Selective Breeding):
-- Corn: Historically was an inch and a half long with little edible matter.
-- Brussels Sprouts: Tasted horrible just 30 years ago; entirely reinvented.
-- Apples: You cannot grow edible apples from seeds (they require grafting).
-- Johnny Appleseed: He was actually the "Alcohol Fairy." He planted trees to make apple cider (booze) for frontiersmen, not eating apples.
-- Bananas: Used to require a prescription.
-- Pineapples: Historically cost ~$18,000 (adjusted). People rented them for parties as a flex; they were carved into architecture as symbols of wealth.
-- Dragon Fruit: Now available at BJs; used to be an exotic luxury found only in Beijing/Shanghai.

IV. The Myth of the 1950s Food Utopia

- Thanksgiving Dishes: Many iconic dishes (e.g., Green Bean Casserole = Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom + Canned Beans) come from the 1950s.

- The "Canned" Peak: The 1950s perceived themselves as the peak of hedonism, but their variety came from cans.

- Lack of Cold Chain:
-- Flash freezing and cold chain logistics didn't exist.
-- "Fresh" meant local. Milk was delivered daily because it couldn't be shipped far.
-- Turkey: Was a holiday staple because obtaining a fresh, large animal from a butcher was a rare, difficult luxury. Today, we have invented better foods than roast turkey.

V. Historical Hardships: The Reality Check

- Hygiene & Plumbing:
-- Wiping: For most of history, people wiped themselves with their index finger (Reference: Book *Clean*).
-- Hot Water: The Collins live in a 200-year-old house; the first bathtub was in a random room near the kitchen to be filled by hand from the fireplace. Modern hot showers are a "mind-blowing" luxury.

- Medical Horrors:
-- Louis XIV: Had an infection in his butt (anal fistulas) so bad that feces came out of the rotting hole.
-- Henry VIII: Suffered profoundly in ways modern medicine would cure instantly.

- Reproductive Bottlenecks:
-- There were periods where 17 women reproduced for every 1 man.
-- The Past Incel: Didn't have Asmongold’s Korean Dating Sims or AI girlfriends. They lived lives of slavery, torture, and total genetic exclusion. They couldn't even "goon."

- The Boredom Factor ("Raw Dogging Life"):
-- Car Rides: Driving 2 hours meant staring at a seat. No books (carsickness), no phones.
-- Post-9/11 Travel: The period where books/magazines were banned on planes; everyone "raw dogged" flights. The modern mind would break under this boredom.

VI. The Culture of Cynicism vs. Excitement

- Cynicism as a Social Hack:
-- Reference to *30 Rock* ("Pleasure is the name of a pony I hate").
-- Being unironically excited makes you look "lame/pathetic." Being cynical makes you look "cool."

- Wikipedia: When it launched, it was the sum of human knowledge for free. The cultural reaction was to poo-poo it ("Don't cite it!").

- AI Art/Music:
-- Instead of celebrating that non-artists (like Malcolm) can now create music, art, and code, people whine about artists losing jobs.
-- Vibe Coding: Companies being acquired for $80M by people who can't code.
-- AI Music: 97% of people can't distinguish AI songs from human songs.

- The Victimhood Olympics:
-- In urban monocultures, status is gained by proving your life is the hardest.
-- Parenting Hack: Teach teenagers to shame peers who dampen excitement. If someone says, "That's not cool," the kid should reply, "It is evil to tell someone not to be excited about their life."

VII. Agency, Dating, and Strategy

- "The World is Broken" Fallacy:
-- This phrase usually means: "The strategies my parents used don't work anymore."
-- People *are* finding partners today (poor people, unattractive people).

- The Collins' Dating Strategy:
-- They met via online dating when it was stigmatized (for "weirdos/losers").
-- The System: Simone had a points-based Excel sheet to force herself to triage dates. Malcolm did "high throughput" dating (two dates a day).
-- Lesson: If the market is hard, you need more creativity and audacity, not despair.

- Luck vs. Choice (Alcoholism):
-- Malcolm's entire lineage is alcoholic. His mother drank half a bottle of wine a day *while pregnant*.
-- He drinks. He accepts it is a bad choice, but refuses to blame genetics or society. He rejects the victim mindset.

VIII. The Science of Gratitude

- Health Benefits:
-- Gratitude journaling/letters link to lower depression, anxiety, blood pressure, and inflammation.
-- Engages dopamine/serotonin circuits.

- The Sleep Paradox:
-- Study: People who *believed* they slept well (even if they didn't) got the health benefits. People who *believed* they slept poorly (even if they slept well) suffered negative health effects.

- Real vs. Performative Gratitude:
-- The Engagement Spoon: In Appalachian culture, forks/spoons were so rare and valuable that a carved spoon was used to propose marriage.
-- Fine China: Historically, you displayed your plates because they were the only plates you owned.
-- Spices: Wars were fought over salt and pepper.
-- Possum vs. Pad Thai: When Malcolm was 17, the US calorie database included Possum (cooked and raw) but did not include Thai or Indian food.

IX. The Trap of Ultra-Luxury

- The "Greasy Pizza" Analogy:
-- Eating at luxury restaurants every meal (like in NYC) feels like eating a greasy pizza every day. It eventually feels gross, sluggish, and sickly.
-- Malcolm prefers Simone’s one home-cooked meal a day over Michelin star food daily.

- The Loneliness of Wealth:
-- Staying in a 30-40 room mansion overlooking the ocean is the loneliest experience imaginable. The emptiness of the hallways reflects the emptiness in the heart.

- The Misery of Icons:
-- Britney Spears: Posting sad, manic dancing videos; a living nightmare.
-- Michael Jackson: Lived a hellish existence.
-- Howard Hughes: Died a hypochondriac recluse with OCD.
-- Elon Musk: Describes his life as "living hell" on stage.
-- Alexander the Great: Died young, empire crumbled.

- Getty Quote: The billionaire Getty said he would trade his entire fortune for just one woman who would be loyal and good to him.

X. Conclusion & Misc

- Thanksgiving Strategy: The Collins use Black Friday sales to buy an entire year's worth of staples (shoes, socks, underwear) at 25-40% off. It makes them "sick of shopping" for the rest of the year.

- Krampus: Malcolm dresses as Krampus to scare the kids when they are bad. He recently had to stage a sword fight where he "battled" Krampus because his son Octavian wasn't scared ("Daddy always beats Krampus"), so Malcolm now needs to use fake blood to show Krampus winning.

- Recommendation: *The Pragmatist’s Guide to Life* (Retails for $0.99) for structuring meaning in life.

- Final Thought: Do not envy the rich. A middle-class life with purpose, family, and gratitude is vastly superior to the aimless misery of the ultra-elite.
