Rudyard Lynch on Explaining the English Civil War

Summary:
Rudyard Lynch argues that the English Civil War is arguably the most important war in human history—more so than the American Revolution or Civil War—because it established the unique incentive structures (property rights, parliamentarianism, meritocracy) that allowed the Industrial Revolution to happen. If the Royalists had won, England would have likely stagnated like France, preventing the technological singularity of the modern world. The discussion maps the conflict onto "Albion's Seed," showing how the genetic and cultural divides of 17th-century England (Puritan East vs. Cavalier West) directly birthed the American North/South political divide. They also explore the theological roots of modern "Wokeism" in Puritan "accountability" culture, the "Secular Cycle" crisis of the 1600s, and how Oliver Cromwell’s military dictatorship paradoxically birthed liberalism and the British Empire.

1. The Thesis: The Most Important War in History

- The Stakes of the Conflict:
-- Lynch posits that the English Civil War is more consequential than the American Revolution or the American Civil War.
-- The "Arguable" Range: While arguments can be made for the importance of the Jews, Greeks, or Chinese, England holds a unique claim because it birthed the Industrial Revolution.
-- The Counterfactual: Genetic determinism fails here. The English are genetically almost identical to the French, Germans, and Scandinavians. The massive divergence in historical outcome (England creating the steam engine and modern medicine vs. France stagnating) was driven by Incentive Structures and Governance, not IQ.

- Capitalism vs. Mercantilism:
-- The war was fundamentally a struggle between the Parliamentarians (representing the rising Capitalist/Merchant class of the East) and the Royalists (representing the Mercantilist/Feudal class of the West).
-- The Divergence: Because the Capitalists won, England developed strong property rights, a patent system, and a responsive democracy. If the Royalists had won, England would have become an absolutist state like France—wealthy but bureaucratically stifled, delaying or preventing the Industrial Revolution entirely.

- "Why Nations Fail":
-- Lynch references the Acemoglu/Robinson thesis. The pre-war English economy was strangled by Royal Monopolies granted to the King's cronies.
-- The Quote: "My shoes are from a monopoly, my hair gel is from a monopoly, my hat is from a monopoly." The war broke this rent-seeking structure, freeing the market for innovation.

2. The Context: The "Secular Cycle" Crisis (1600s)

- The Golden Age Hangover:
-- The 1500s (Elizabethan Era/Merry England) were a "Golden Age" of population growth, trade expansion (India/Russia), and artistic flourishing (Shakespeare).
-- The Malthusian Trap: By the 1600s, the population had outpaced agricultural output. Wages collapsed. Lynch notes that statistical analysis shows the average Englishman in the early 1600s was "working himself to death"—caloric output exceeded wage-purchasing power.

- The Secular Cycle Structure:
-- Lynch uses Peter Turchin’s theory: Population Boom → Wage Suppression → Inequality → Elite Overproduction → Political Polarization → Religious Fanaticism → Civil War.
-- The English Civil War was the inevitable explosion of this pressure cooker. Homelessness, alcoholism, and opium addiction were rampant in towns, fueling radical religious movements (Puritans) seeking order.

- The "Skipping" Anomaly:
-- Usually, a society hits a crisis every ~70-80 years (e.g., US Civil War → Great Depression/WWII).
-- The Miracle: England skipped the next expected cycle (c. 1848). While Europe burned in the revolutions of 1848, England was stable.
-- The Mechanism: The Agricultural Revolution was a direct result of the Civil War. The victory of the gentry established property rights (Enclosure Acts), which incentivized fertilizer, breeding, and seed innovation.
-- The Data: This doubled English wages and food production. In contrast, France (which stayed absolutist) only saw wages improve by ~33%. This surplus allowed England to escape the Malthusian trap and launch the Industrial Revolution, creating a 400-year run of stability.

3. The Factions: Geography, Genetics, and "Albion's Seed"

- The Geographic Split:
-- The East (Parliament/Puritan): Flat, arable land. Dominated by the wool trade with the Netherlands/Belgium. Highly monetized economy, urbanized, genetically more "Germanic/Anglo-Saxon."
-- The West (Royalist/Cavalier): Hilly, pastoral. Dominated by huge feudal estates and old nobility. Less market-integrated. Genetically more "Celtic/Brittonic."
-- The North: A wild card. The Northeast (York) was Royalist; the Northwest (Lancashire) bred religious radicals (Quakers) who sided with Parliament.

- The American Connection ("The Cousins' Wars"):
-- Lynch references Kevin Phillips and David Hackett Fischer (Albion's Seed). America is described as a "side effect" of the English Civil War. The factions didn't disappear; they migrated.
-- Yankees (New England): Descendants of the East Anglian Puritans (Parliamentarians). Cultural values: Collective accountability, education, intolerance of sin, "ordered liberty."
-- Southerners (Virginia/Deep South): Descendants of the West Country Cavaliers (Royalists). Cultural values: Honor culture, hierarchy, independence, "hegemonic liberty."
-- Midwesterners: Descendants of the North Country Quakers. Pacifist, egalitarian.
-- Appalachians: Descendants of the Border Reivers/Scots-Irish. Warrior culture, clan-based, anti-government.
-- The Conclusion: The American Civil War was essentially a replay of the English Civil War with the same ethnic groups fighting for the same reasons (Puritan systems vs. Cavalier hierarchy). The map of the English Civil War aligns almost perfectly with the map of American political divides today.

4. Theology as Politics: The Roots of "Wokeism"

- Religion = Politics:
-- In the 1600s, people didn't suffer from modern nihilism ("what do I do with my life?"). Religion provided the script. To understand them, one must view their theological disputes with the intensity of modern political polarization (e.g., Abortion).

- The Puritans (Proto-Progressives):
-- Profile: Lynch describes Puritans as "Sigma Males" trapped in a chaotic world, using hyper-discipline to gain control. They fined people for laziness, drunkenness, or arguing with wives.
-- The "Woke" Link: Austin Padget points out the direct lineage between Puritan theology and modern Progressivism.
-- Puritan Concept: "Discernment" (Identifying sin in yourself and others) is a "loving act" to save the community from God’s wrath.
-- Modern Progressive Concept: "Accountability" (Identifying privilege/bias) is the "love language" of social justice.
-- Mechanism: Both systems reject "Live and let live." They demand universal compliance to a moral standard to prevent collective punishment. Wokeness is simply Puritanism without the deity.

- The Catholics: The hated minority (~10%). They were the "Deep State" of the era—feared, insular, high-status nobility, and often secretly supported by the Monarchy (Charles I & II).

5. The War Mechanics: How Parliament Won

- The Trigger:
-- King Charles I tried to enforce Anglican prayer books on Presbyterian Scotland. Scotland invaded England (The Bishop's Wars).
-- The King needed money to fight the Scots. He called Parliament to raise taxes. Parliament said "No" unless he gave up power. He tried to arrest them; the war started.

- The "Seesaw" Conflict:
-- Phase 1 (Royalist Ascendancy): The Cavaliers won early victories. They had the nobility, better horses, and a martial culture.
-- Phase 2 (The Turn): Parliament controlled London (Finance/Customs) and the East (Manpower). They had the money to sustain a long war.
-- The "Cheat Code": The New Model Army. Oliver Cromwell created a meritocratic, professional standing army with uniforms and drill (copied from the Dutch and Romans). This crushed the feudal levies of the King.

- Key Battles:
-- Marston Moor: Parliament secures the North, linking their territories.
-- Naseby: The decisive crushing of the Royalist army.

6. Oliver Cromwell: The "Realist" Dictator

- The Revolutionary Cycle:
-- Lynch cites Eric Hoffer (The True Believer). Revolutions have three stages:
        1.  The Prophet: Invents the idea (Puritan theologians).
        2.  The Fanatic: Destroys the old order (The Parliamentarians).
        3.  The Realist: Seizes power and builds the state (Cromwell).

- Cromwell's Governance:
-- He became Lord Protector (Military Dictator). He eventually crushed the very Parliament he fought for because they became too radical/ineffective.
-- The "Nanny State": He banned Christmas, theater, and sports.
-- The Paradox: Despite being a Puritan, he was arguably the most tolerant leader of the era regarding Protestant dissent. Under him, Quakers, Baptists, and Diggers flourished because he didn't enforce a state church. He also readmitted the Jews to England (for economic reasons).

- The Conquests:
-- Ireland: Cromwell killed ~1/3 of the Irish population through the sword, famine, and slavery (sending them to Barbados). He viewed Catholic Ireland as a strategic threat and sought to ethnically cleanse the ruling class. "Tobacco Island" by Flogging Molly references this.
-- Scotland: He crushed the Scots (who had betrayed him by backing the King later in the war).
-- The Navy: The Navy was originally Royalist. Cromwell purged it and built the professional British Navy that would rule the waves for 300 years, introducing line-of-battle tactics.

7. The Restoration & The Glorious Revolution

- General Monck (The Unsung Hero):
-- After Cromwell died, his son failed, and the republic collapsed into anarchy. General Monck marched his army on London, restored order, and invited the King (Charles II) back. Lynch calls him a genius for stabilizing the nation without seizing power himself.

- Charles II (The Party King):
-- To heal the nation, the Monarchy threw a 25-year party.
-- Strategy: Libertinism, partying, and hedonism were used to de-escalate political tension. The vibe was: "We don't want you to take us seriously, we just want to network and vibe."
-- The Empire: He granted massive land tracts in America (Pennsylvania to Penn, Carolinas to his buddies) to pay off debts, accidentally founding the distinct American regional cultures.

- The Glorious Revolution (1688):
-- James II (Charles's brother) succeeded the throne. He was openly Catholic. The English tolerated him until he had a son, threatening a permanent Catholic dynasty.
-- The Solution: The "Immortal 7" (powerful nobles) invited William of Orange (Dutch Stadtholder) to invade England.
-- Result: A bloodless coup (in England) that established Parliamentary Supremacy. The King became a figurehead. This cemented the capitalist/Whig victory, leading to the establishment of the Bank of England, the stock market, and the modern state.
-- Significance: England has not had a regime change since 1688—the longest streak of stability in modern history.
