Nathan Cofnas on The Right’s Stupidity Problem

Summary: 
An internal critique of the political Right, arguing that Conservatives are losing the culture war because they are intellectually inferior to Liberals. Cofnas presents data showing a significant IQ gap between the Left and Right, arguing that smart people flock to Wokism because it is the only logically consistent response to the "Equality Thesis." He critiques alternative theories of Wokism (Rufo’s Philosophy theory, Hanania’s Law theory) and concludes that the Right can only win by embracing "Hereditarianism" (Race Realism) to shatter the premise of Wokism.

1. The Stupidity Problem: Evidence of the IQ Gap

- The "National Divorce" Fantasy:
-- Cofnas argues a "Conservative States of America" would be a failed state: A middle-income country wasting its budget on abortion hunting and "Pyramid of Giza-scale Ten Commandments."
-- Cultural Dependency: Conservatives are unable to produce culture; they would still import movies from "Wokistan" and complain about them.

- The Data (General Social Survey):
-- Wordsum IQ: When restricted to Whites, "Extreme Liberals" score 107, "Liberals" score 105, "Conservatives" score 101, and "Extreme Conservatives" score 98.5.
-- Implication: An 8.5 IQ point gap between the extremes is massive at the population level. It explains why Liberals dominate complex institution-building.

- Institutional Failure:
-- Universities: Of the top 50 US universities, 28 are American. 23 are in Blue States. The 5 in Red States (e.g., Duke, UT Austin) are politically Blue islands.
-- Media: The Right has failed to create a competitor to the NYT or The Atlantic.
-- Tucker Carlson: In 2009, he lucidly argued for fact-based conservative news. By 2023, he was peddling UFOs and "Obama gay sex" conspiracies to pander to his low-IQ audience.
-- The Vox/Veritasium Gap: The Right cannot produce high-production-value, fact-based explainer content (like Vox or Vsauce) because the talent pool doesn't exist.

2. Defining Wokism: Logic, Not Madness

- The Formula: Wokism = Equality Thesis (All groups have equal innate potential) + Christian Morality (We must care for the downtrodden).

- The Logical Conclusion: If all groups are equal, then any disparity (IQ, Income, Crime) must be the result of environmental injustice (Racism/Sexism).

- Why Smart People Choose Wokism:
-- Intelligent people spot patterns. They see the Right's position as incoherent: Conservatives claim to believe in equality but oppose the remedies (Affirmative Action) necessary to fix the "injustice."
-- Wokism offers a coherent (albeit empirically false) explanation for the world: "Hidden Racism" (Microaggressions, Structural Racism) explains why disparities persist despite legal equality.

3. Critique of Alternative Theories (Rufo & Hanania)
Cofnas argues that Rufo and Hanania mistake effects for causes.

A. Christopher Rufo (Wokism as Philosophy)

- The Theory: Critical Theorists (Marcuse, Bell, Freire) marched through the institutions and conquered them.

- The Rebuttal:
-- Pushing on an Open Door: Critical Theory didn't conquer; the elites invited it in. The elites were already committed to the Equality Thesis and needed a philosophy to explain why equality hadn't happened yet.
-- Agency: "Critical Theory" has no agency. University presidents chose to create Gender Studies departments because they were already ideologically aligned.

B. Richard Hanania (Wokism as Law)

- The Theory: Civil Rights Law (Civil Rights Act of 1964) created Wokism. Bureaucrats interpreted "disparate impact" as discrimination, forcing companies to go woke to avoid lawsuits.

- The Rebuttal:
-- The Timeline: The bureaucracy was woke before the law. Judges interpreted the law to require quotas (against the text of the law) because they already believed in the Woke moral imperative.
-- International Wokism: Canada, Sweden, and the UK are woker than the US despite having different legal histories. Wokism is an elite cultural phenomenon, not just a US legal one.
-- Employee Demand: Companies go woke not just to avoid lawsuits, but to attract high-IQ talent (who are Liberals).

4. The Trap of "Soft Realism" (Sowellism)

- The Conservative Cope: attributing disparities to "Culture" (Thomas Sowell’s view).

- Why it Fails:
    1.  Scientifically False: Racial disparities track genetics globally, regardless of local culture.
    2.  The "Who Broke It?" Trap: Even if "Bad Black Culture" were the cause, the Left simply asks: "Who destroyed Black culture?" The answer leads back to Slavery/Jim Crow, justifying Wokism again.
    3.  Unconvincing: Smart elites know that "Culture" cannot explain why Nigerian immigrants' children regress to the African-American mean.

5. The Solution: Hereditarianism (Race Realism)

- The Only Way Out: You cannot defeat Wokism without destroying its premise (The Equality Thesis).

- Refuting Colorblindness:
-- If we enforced true colorblind meritocracy (as Rufo/Hanania want), Black representation at Harvard would drop to 0.7%. Blacks would vanish from the elite.
-- Society would not accept this. The elites would revolt and reinstate Wokism to "fix" the optics.

- The Strategic Plan:
    1.  Promote Knowledge: Normalize the genetic explanation for disparities.
    2.  Change Decision Makers: Legally purge Woke commissars (via state power).
    3.  Leverage Power: Use the state to dismantle Woke departments.

6. The "Race Realist" Problem (Low Quality Personnel)

- The Paradox: While the Right needs Hereditarianism, the current self-identified "Race Realist" community is unintelligent.

- The Data: Whites who attribute disparities to genes have lower Verbal IQs (Wordsum) than environmentalists.

- Right-Wing Wokism: Many "Race Realists" are just "Right-Wing Wokesters"—instead of blaming Whites for everything, they blame Jews ("The JQ"). They are conspiracy theorists, not scientists.

- The Strategy: The Hereditarian Revolution must come from the Top Down (Intellectuals/Elites), not the Bottom Up (Groypers/Neo-Nazis). We need a new political philosophy that appeals to the current Left-Wing elite.

Related Rebuttal - Elite Human Capital Debunked
Summary: A critical response to Richard Hanania and Anatoly Karlin’s theory of "Elite Human Capital" (EHC). The author argues that Hanania falsely bundles high IQ with Leftist ideology to claim Liberals rule via merit. The critique asserts that the IQ gap is trivial and historically recent, that institutional dominance is the result of a rigged system (not meritocracy), and that in other contexts (like Russia), the "Elite Human Capital" is nationalist and pro-regime, proving that elites simply align with power rather than "Woke" values.

1. Deconstructing "Elite Human Capital" (EHC)

- The Hanania/Karlin Definition: A unified framework combining High Intelligence, Activism, Openness, Liberal norms, and Leftism.

- The Critique: The author argues this is a false amalgamation. High IQ and Leftism do not inherently correlate; Hanania is "overstretching" the definition to "own the chuds."

- The Operational Definition: In practice, EHC is defined by:
-- Dislike of Rightism.
-- Status-Signaling (Luxury Beliefs).
-- High Income/Education.
-- "We’re powerful, therefore we win": A psychological desire to feel like one is in the driver's seat of history.

- The "Physiognomy Check" Equivalent: Just as the Right dismisses people based on looks (physiognomy), the EHC framework dismisses opinions not based on truth, but on whether the speaker is "elite coded."

2. The Intelligence Gap: Fact vs. Fiction

- The Central Claim: Hanania argues Liberals rule because they are smarter (citing Wordsum/IQ data).

- The Rebuttal:
-- Trivial Differences: The gap is real but small (1–3 IQ points). It is not large enough to explain total institutional dominance.
-- The Race Factor: The IQ-Liberal correlation exists only among Whites.
-- Non-Whites: Educated Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to back Trump/Rightism than their uneducated counterparts.
-- Image: https://i.imgur.com/OrOF5dg.png
-- The "Moderate" Irony: Hanania identifies as a moderate, yet data shows "Moderates" have the lowest Wordsum scores of all groups.
-- Historical Context: In the 2000s (Bush era), the voting patterns did not show this massive IQ skew. It is a recent trend, not a biological constant.

3. Meritocracy vs. The Rigged System

- Hanania’s Hypothesis: The system benefits Liberals because Liberals are "exceptionally talented people" (Meritocracy).

- The Statistical Refutation (Noah Carl):
-- If academia were a meritocracy based solely on IQ, Conservatives would comprise ~30% of the professoriate.
-- Reality: Conservatives comprise ~5%.
-- Conclusion: The disparity is not due to low Conservative IQ, but due to systemic discrimination and "self-reproducing centralization" (purges).

- The Historical Flaw: In the 1970s-90s, Republicans held an advantage in IQ, Income, and Wealth. Yet, they did not dominate the universities or culture. This proves that high human capital does not automatically grant institutional capture; the system is rigged.

4. The Future: Fertility and the "Smart Conservative"

- The Trend: Due to massive partisan fertility gaps, the future belongs to the Right.

- The Data:
-- Fertility Gap: Strong Republicans (1.76 kids) vs. Strong Democrats (1.37 kids).
-- The Projection: In 50 years, "Smart Conservatives" (Above Average IQ) will outnumber "Smart Liberals" by 4 to 1.
-- Image: https://i.imgur.com/dEIvZJg.jpeg
-- Current Shift: Recent data shows a 27-point shift toward the Right among young college-educated White men. The "Brain Drain" from the Right is reversing.

5. Counter-Example: Russia (EHC is not Inherently Woke)
The author uses Russia to demonstrate that "Elite Human Capital" adapts to the regime, rather than being inherently Liberal/Leftist.

- Vaccines & Institutions:
-- The West: Elites/Liberals are Pro-Vax; Rightists are skeptics.
-- Russia: The Elites (Putin supporters) are Pro-Vax; Liberals/Leftists (Yabloko supporters) are Anti-Vax.
-- Theory: People trust institutions that benefit them. In the West, institutions hate the Right, so the Right distrusts them. In Russia, institutions hate the Liberals, so Liberals distrust them.

- Support for the War (SMO):
-- Upper Class: 85% support the Special Military Operation.
-- Lowest Class: Only 59% support it.
-- Regret: Highly educated Russians are less likely (34%) to want to reverse the decision to start the war than uneducated ones.

- Conclusion:
-- Russian Elites are not Gay/Trans/Woke. They have children (unlike Western billionaires).
-- They support Putin not because they are "dumb," but because:
        1.  It is advantageous to align with power.
        2.  Russian elites are selected for conformity to the State.
-- Final Verdict: EHC is not a metric of "Liberalism"; it is a metric of Power Alignment. Hanania conflates "Smart" with "Woke" only because he observes the West in isolation.

Marino's Additional Notes

- The IQ gap isn't inherent, but what does seem to be more inherent is that high IQ is strongly correlated with high openness.

- They will tend towards wokeness if they are not hereditarian: to expect Russia's elites are hereditarian.

- People like Cofnas and Cremieux and other more academic types are ones who have a chance at influencing them.

- Power games are also real, and Rufo is good at them, but it's swimming against the tide without more comfort with hereditarianism. Still very necessary though, because it opens up cracks to let in these ideas. Necessary but not sufficient.

- Actually, if you have blank slatists who are very comfortable with unequal outcomes, that may be a sign that you've filtered for a particularly power hungry and corruptible crowd. Not ideal.
