Geoffrey Miller on Virtue Signaling (2019)

Summary:
Virtue Signaling collects seven essays by evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller that dissect human political behavior through the lens of Darwinian sexual selection. Miller argues that ideology, morality, and language evolved not primarily for group survival, but as "courtship displays" designed to signal intelligence, conscientiousness, and genetic fitness to potential mates. The book applies Amotz Zahavi's "Handicap Principle" to explain why political activism is often performative and costly rather than efficient. Later essays pivot to the "Culture Wars," arguing that modern campus speech codes and corporate diversity initiatives paradoxically discriminate against "neurominorities" (such as those on the autism spectrum) and foreign students, who lack the intuitive social processing required to navigate shifting "woke" norms. Miller advocates for a return to free speech to protect the "eccentric" thinkers vital to civilization.

Chapter I: Political Peacocks

1. The Origins of "Political Peacocking"

- The Context:
-- Miller contrasts his upbringing by pragmatic, centrist parents (who viewed politics as quiet committee work) with the noisy activism he encountered at Columbia University in the 1980s.
-- The Columbia Protests (1985): Miller recounts the anti-apartheid protests where students occupied Hamilton Hall. He observed a disconnect between the ardor of the protests and their practical political efficacy; middle-class Americans were risking jail and missing classes for a cause 6,000 miles away.
-- The "Front Row Seat": Living next to the protest, Miller observed the sensory overload of the event, including the relentless playing of "Free Nelson Mandela" by The Specials, which disrupted sleep and study—a key feature of "costly" signaling.

- The Insight:
-- The "Mating Ritual" Cartoon: A conservative campus paper satirized the protests as an annual "springtime mating ritual" with Dionysian revels. Miller realized that while intended as mockery, the cartoon contained a scientific truth.
-- The Function: The protests were inefficient politically but highly effective socially. They brought together young men and women with shared ideologies, leading to sexual relationships that often outlasted the political causes themselves.
-- The Thesis: Public advertisements of political ideology function as courtship displays, analogous to the peacock’s tail or the nightingale’s song.

2. Darwinian History: From Survival to Sex

- Darwin’s Pivot:
-- After publishing The Origin of Species (1859), Darwin became bored with natural selection by the inanimate environment. He shifted focus to how animal and human minds shape evolution.
-- Key Works: He explored this in On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilized by Insects (1862) and finally in The Descent of Man (1871), which introduced Sexual Selection.

- The Logic of Choosiness:
-- Darwin observed that females are often picky. The rationale: "Random mating is stupid mating."
-- Field Eugenics: Mate choice is essentially genetic screening carried out without technological equipment. By choosing a high-quality mate, an animal ensures its genes are passed on in a high-quality vehicle (the offspring).

- The "Wallace" Deviation:
-- Alfred Russell Wallace (co-discoverer of natural selection) rejected female choice. He argued that ornaments were merely outlets for a "surplus of energy."
-- Modern Echoes: This fallacious "surplus" argument persists today in anthropological theories that view art and music as "self-expression" rather than signaling adaptations.

- The Scientific Exile:
-- The "Modern Synthesis" of the 1930s (genetics + Darwinism) largely rejected female choice, assuming ornaments were just for species recognition or intimidation.
-- The Revival: Sexual selection theory was only re-established in the 1980s through mathematical models and computer simulations, validating Darwin’s original insight.

3. The Biological Criteria for Courtship Displays

- The Checklist: Sexual ornaments (like the bowerbird’s nest or peacock’s tail) have specific, identifiable features that distinguish them from survival adaptations. They are:
-- Expensive: High cost in energy, time, and resources to produce and maintain.
-- Conspicuous: They are designed to stimulate the senses (loud, bright, rhythmic, complex).
-- Handicaps: They impose survival costs (making the animal more visible to predators) but offer reproductive benefits.
-- Demographically Specific: They occur more often after reproductive maturity, during the breeding season, and (usually) in males more than females.
-- Fashion Cycles: They evolve according to unpredictable cycles that change the content of the display while maintaining the complexity/cost.

- Application to Humans: Most human behaviors classified as "culture," "ideology," and "politics" fit these biological criteria perfectly. They are costly, complex, creative displays used to attract attention from other minds.

4. The "Ideological Animal" Hypothesis

- The Brain Explosion: Human brain size tripled over the last two million years. Miller argues this happened too fast to be driven solely by survival needs; it was driven by runaway sexual selection.

- Language as Telepathy:
-- Language allows the transmission of complex ideas from one head to another. It opened a window into other minds, moving the arena of courtship from physical traits (bodies) to conceptual traits (ideas).
-- Selection Pressure: The environment stopped being the primary selector; other minds became the selector. Our ancestors chose mates based on their ability to be interesting, articulate, and inventive.
-- Survival of the Wittiest: "The prehistoric Cyranos reproduced more successfully than the Homer Simpsons."

- The Content Necessity:
-- Unlike bird songs, human language has complex content. This allows individuals to advertise their minds—their knowledge, memory, imagination, and personality traits—to potential partners.
-- The evolutionary purpose of ideology is to be entertaining and impressive to others, not necessarily to represent the world accurately.

5. Solving Political Puzzles

- The Paradox of Participation:
-- Most people have zero actual political power, yet they broadcast strong political convictions incessantly. If politics were about rational self-interest (the economist's view), this time-costly behavior makes no sense. It only makes sense as a social and sexual signal.

- Sex Differences & Ideology:
-- The Data: Cross-cultural studies show men are generally more conservative, authoritarian, and rights-oriented, while women are more liberal and empathy-oriented.
-- The Signaling Explanation:
-- Conservatism: Signals an ambitious, self-interested personality likely to excel at protecting and provisioning a mate (Social Dominance).
-- Liberalism: Signals a caring, empathetic personality likely to excel at childcare and relationship building.

- Life History Shifts:
-- The tendency to move from liberal youth to conservative middle age is not just "getting wiser." It reflects a mating-relevant increase in social dominance and earning power. As individuals acquire resources, they switch signals to advertise their ability to retain and defend those resources.

- The Revolutionary Male:
-- Why are most ideological revolutions initiated by young single men?
-- Reproductive Variance: Young males have the most to gain and least to lose. They engage in high-risk courtship behaviors—like leading a revolution—to signal fitness and acquire status in a competitive mating market.

6. Frequency-Dependent Selection & Policy

- The "Acid Test":
-- In mating games, the attractiveness of a signal depends on what others are doing (Game Theory).
-- Capricious Shifts: Once a critical mass of students decided anti-apartheid views were the metric for "having one's heart in the right place," it became impossible for anyone else to be apathetic without losing mating status.
-- The Logic: The specific political issue doesn't matter; what matters is the consensus that this issue is the current test of moral quality.

- The Pragmatic Conclusion:
-- Policy Failure: Policy analysts fail when they treat humans as rational citizens concerned with the polity.
-- Policy Success: "Spin doctors" and pollsters succeed because they recognize humans as "big-brained, idea-infested, hypersexual primates." They exploit the lust for ideology.

- The Saving Grace:
-- While sexual selection created our flashy, protean ideologies, other evolutionary forces (kin selection, reciprocal altruism) favored political rationality and egalitarianism. We are a mix of showy peacocks (sexual selection) and pragmatic cooperators (social selection).

Chapter II: The Handicap Principle

1. Context: The Intellectual Earthquake

- Miller’s Personal Evolution:
-- The Graduate School Obsession (1987-1992): At Stanford, Miller was fixated on sexual selection, running "genetic algorithm" computer simulations to understand runaway selection and speciation. He encountered Amotz Zahavi’s original 1975 paper on handicaps, which was initially ridiculed by the biological establishment as biologically impossible or mathematically unsound.
-- The Conversion Experience: Working as a researcher at the Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution (UCL) in 1996, Miller received a "crash course" in game theory. By the mid-90s, the logic of the handicap principle "grew on him" until he viewed it as one of the "deepest ideas in evolutionary theory"—a master key applicable not just to bird tails, but to economics, consumerism, and political ideology.
-- The "Signs of Quality" Conference (1999): To promote these ideas, Miller organized a landmark conference at the London Zoological Society. He flew Amotz Zahavi up from Israel to speak. The event marked a turning point where handicap theory began to bridge biology, economics, and culture.

- The Book Itself:
-- The Handicap Principle (1997) is described as a "family affair." It was written by Amotz and his wife Avishag (a biologist), and translated from Hebrew by their daughter Naama and son-in-law Melvin.
-- Miller characterizes the book as "quirky," "maddening," but "essential." It features beautiful illustrations by Amir Balaban and presents a revolutionary argument accessible even to undergraduates.

2. The Core Conflict: Utilitarian vs. Signal Selection

- The Darwinian Efficiency Principle (Utilitarian Selection):
-- Standard Logic: Conventional evolutionary theory posits that adaptations maximize efficiency. Survival depends on doing more with less.
-- The Expectation: An adaptation should minimize costs (calories, time, risk) while maximizing benefits. For example, a heart should pump blood using the minimum necessary energy; a wing should generate lift with minimal drag.
-- The Anomaly: Nature is filled with traits that seem blatantly inefficient: heavy peacock tails, massive elk antlers, bright colors that attract predators, and energy-wasting behaviors like stotting.

- The Handicap Solution (Signal Selection):
-- The Paradox of Communication: When an organism needs to reveal its quality (strength, intelligence, fitness) to another (a mate, a rival, a predator), efficiency becomes a liability. If a signal is efficient (cheap), low-quality imitators can fake it.
-- Waste as a Validator: Under "signal selection," waste is not a bug; it is the primary feature. Only a signal that imposes a prohibitive, differential cost can reliably distinguish between high-quality and low-quality individuals.
-- The Maxim: "Only profligate wastes of fitness by oneself can signal high fitness to others." If a signal is cheap, it conveys no information. If it is expensive, it proves the sender has resources to burn.

3. Case Studies in Costly Signaling

- The Peacock’s Tail:
-- Fisherian Runaway View: The costs of the tail are unfortunate side-effects of an arbitrary aesthetic preference by females.
-- Zahavian Handicap View: The costs are the functional mechanism. The tail is a burden that tests the male’s metabolic competence. Only a healthy, parasite-free, well-fed male can grow and drag around such a heavy, conspicuous tail without dying.
-- The Message: The tail effectively says, "I am so fit that I can survive even with this massive handicap. Imagine how strong my genes must be."

- The Stotting Gazelle:
-- The Behavior: When a gazelle spots a predator (e.g., a cheetah), instead of running away immediately (efficiency), it jumps straight up and down repeatedly (stotting), displaying its white rump.
-- The "Waste": This burns calories and reduces the distance between predator and prey.
-- The Strategic Logic: It is a signal to the predator: "I am in such excellent physical condition that you will not catch me. Don't bother trying."
-- Non-Zero-Sum Game: Since the predator wants to avoid a failed chase (wasted energy) and the prey wants to avoid being chased (risk of death), they have a shared interest in honest communication. The signal works because a weak, sick, or tired gazelle physically cannot stott impressively.

- Other Examples:
-- Slime Molds: Conflicts over which cells become reproductive spores vs. non-reproductive stalks are resolved through chemical signaling wars.
-- Parent-Offspring Conflict: Baby birds beg loudly (attracting predators and burning calories) to prove to parents that they are truly hungry, rather than just greedy.

4. Methodological Controversies & The "Necker Cube"

- The Dual Nature of the Theory:
-- Miller describes the Handicap Principle as oscillating like a Necker cube. From one angle, it is a simple playground truth ("if you want to prove you're rich, buy things poor people can't afford"). From another angle, it is a deep, paradoxical concept in mathematical biology.

- The "Methodological Nightmare":
-- Miller critiques the Zahavis' book for lacking rigorous scientific formalism. It contains no formal game theory models, no proofs of Nash equilibria, and no uniqueness proofs for the signaling equilibria.
-- Lack of Testing: The authors present "counter-intuitive functional hypotheses" without experimental data on reproductive success or comparative phylogenies. They rely on field anecdotes and "armchair speculation."
-- Hyper-Adaptationism: They are accused of weaving "just-so stories" even more aggressively than Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett.

- The Panglossian Temptation:
-- Miller warns of a risk to evolutionary psychology: If a trait is efficient, scientists call it a "standard adaptation." If it is inefficient/wasteful, they can now call it a "Zahavian handicap."
-- The Danger: This complementarity means evolutionary theory can explain everything, which risks explaining nothing (unfalsifiability) unless rigorous criteria are applied.

- Implications for Psychology:
-- Standard evolutionary psychology (Tooby/Cosmides) focuses on species-typical universals (human nature).
-- Handicap theory focuses on individual differences (who is better?). It implies that much of human behavior is advertising heritable fitness differences, bridging the gap between evolutionary psychology and behavior genetics.

5. The Arabian Babbler & The Critique of Altruism

- The Subject: The Arabian Babbler (Turdoides squamiceps) is a three-ounce, group-living songbird studied by the Zahavis for three decades in the desert.

- The Anomalous Behaviors: They act as sentinels (watching for predators), share food with non-relatives, and mob predators.

- The Theoretical Clash:
-- Reciprocal Altruism (Trivers): Predicts that individuals should try to "cheat"—i.e., receive the protection/food without paying the cost.
-- The Reality: The Babblers compete to be the altruist. Dominant birds will attack subordinates who try to act as sentinels, driving them off to take the risky spot themselves. They forcibly stuff food down the throats of reluctant non-relatives.

- Competitive Altruism (The Prestige Economy):
-- The birds are using "altruistic" acts as handicaps to display their fitness.
-- The Signal: By taking on the risk of being a sentinel or the caloric cost of giving away food, the bird signals: "I am so superior, and my resource-gathering ability is so high, that I can afford to protect and feed you."
-- The Payoff: High-status birds (the best signalers) gain prestige, which translates into better reproductive prospects within the group. The "altruism" is actually a selfish status display.

6. Group Selection via Equilibrium Selection

- Solving the Free-Rider Problem:
-- Miller highlights a groundbreaking argument for how "genuine" altruism can evolve without violating game-theoretic selfishness.

- The Two-Equilibrium Model:
-- Imagine two populations of birds competing for status.
-- Group A (Wasteful): Birds compete for prestige by throwing food into the sea. (Nash Equilibrium: Selfish signaling, zero group benefit).
-- Group B (Pro-Social): Birds compete for prestige by feeding non-relatives. (Nash Equilibrium: Selfish signaling, high group benefit).

- The Selection Mechanism:
-- Both scenarios are stable equilibria where individuals act rationally to maximize status. An individual in Group A cannot switch to feeding others, or he loses the status game.
-- However, Group Selection will favor populations that stumble upon the Pro-Social Equilibrium (Group B) because the group as a whole thrives (Pareto-superiority).
-- Conclusion: Groups that evolve to use pro-social acts as their handicaps will outcompete groups that use wasteful acts as handicaps. This explains the "trickle of genuine altruism" in humans: it is a sexually-selected handicap that group selection has steered toward social utility.

Chapter III: Why Bother to Speak

1. The Context: The "Big Question"

- The Assignment: In 2002, New Scientist asked Miller to contribute to a collection titled "Big Questions in Science." Miller chose the evolution of language, a field that had seen a renaissance in the 1990s after a century of academic neglect.

- The Gap in the Literature:
-- While books like Steven Pinker’s The Language Instinct (1994) and Terence Deacon’s The Symbolic Species (1997) did excellent work explaining the mechanisms of language (the "how"), Miller felt they failed to address the incentives (the "why").
-- The Paradox: Chimpanzees do not speak. Humans do. Speaking is metabolically expensive and socially risky. Why did our species bother to start doing it?

2. The Graveyard of Old Theories

- 1. The "Upper Paleolithic Revolution" (John Pfeiffer, late 1960s):
-- Theory: Language appeared suddenly ~40,000 years ago in Europe, coinciding with the explosion of cave art, figurines, and complex tools.
-- The Refutation: Genetic evidence proves that Africans and Australian Aborigines diverged from Europeans before 40,000 years ago. Since all these groups possess fully complex language, language must have evolved much earlier (at least 100,000+ years ago in Africa), predating the European "revolution."

- 2. The "Mute Neanderthal" (Philip Lieberman, early 1970s):
-- Theory: Reconstructions of Neanderthal throat anatomy suggested they couldn't produce the full range of modern vowels, implying they were mute.
-- The Refutation: Modern paleontology suggests the throat reconstruction was flawed. More importantly, even if they couldn't pronounce a perfect "E" or "O," that doesn't mean they couldn't speak. Complex language does not require a perfect modern vocal tract (Stephen Hawking communicated with a synthesizer; the content matters more than the timbre).

- 3. The "Naive Information Sharing" (Konrad Lorenz era):
-- Theory: Animals communicate to share useful information for the good of the species or group.
-- The Refutation: The "Dawkins/Krebs Revolution" (1978) destroyed this view.

3. The Dawkins/Krebs Revolution: Communication as Manipulation

- The Selfish Gene logic: Richard Dawkins and John Krebs argued that animal communication is not about "sharing"; it is about manipulating others to further one's own genetic interests.

- Narcissism of Signals:
-- Most animal signals are not about the external world; they are about the signaler.
-- Examples: Bird songs, whale songs, and fruit fly dances say: "I’m here, I’m male, I’m healthy, copulate with me."
-- Begging: Baby birds gap their mouths not to inform parents of objective metabolic data, but to manipulate parents into feeding them more than their siblings.

- The Rarity of World-Info:
-- Animals rarely tell each other anything about the world (location of food, predators) unless they are close kin (Kin Selection).
-- Exceptions: Bees tell sisters about pollen; vervet monkeys warn relatives of leopards.
-- The Rule: Most animals keep useful knowledge to themselves because information is power. Giving it away to genetic rivals is evolutionary suicide.

4. The "Altruism Problem" of Human Speech

- The Puzzle: Human language is an anomaly because we constantly provide useful, interesting, true information to non-relatives (strangers, casual friends, audiences).

- The Cost: From a game-theoretic perspective, speaking is an act of altruism. You are giving away valuable data that helps others survive or prosper, often at the expense of your own competitive advantage.

- Critique of "Ape Language" Research:
-- Researchers like Sue Savage-Rumbaugh can teach chimps to use symbols, but only by bribing them with food.
-- The Missing Link: In the wild, there were no human experimenters on the African savanna 200,000 years ago handing out M&Ms every time a hominid uttered a sentence. We need an endogenous evolutionary payoff for the speaker.

5. Critique of Robin Dunbar’s "Gossip Theory"

- The Theory: In Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language (1996), Dunbar argued that language evolved as a cheap substitute for physical grooming. As primate groups got larger, physical grooming became too time-consuming. "Vocal grooming" (chatter) allowed humans to service multiple relationships simultaneously.

- The Strength: It explains the social function of language and solves the time-budget problem.

- The "Content" Weakness:
-- Dunbar’s theory explains why we make noise, but not why we have content (syntax, semantics, stories).
-- The "Contact Call" Alternative: If language is just about servicing relationships, we could have evolved to hum pleasant tunes or use "contact calls" (like dolphins' signature whistles or primate pant-hoots).
-- The Question: Why do we gossip about specific events ("Did you see how much weight Geri lost?") rather than just making meaningless, reassuring noises? Dunbar says the vacuousness of gossip supports his theory; Miller argues the specific details of gossip matter immensely.

6. The Solution: Sexual Selection & The "Prehistoric Cyrano"

- The Precursor: Anthropologist Robbins Burling (1986) noted that in egalitarian tribes, men gain social status through public speaking (oratory). High status leads to more wives/affairs. Thus, oratory is sexually selected.

- Miller’s Expansion:
-- The Content is the Display: We don't just speak to convey facts; we speak to display the quality of our minds.
-- Language as Telepathy: Language opens a window into the brain. It allows a potential mate to assess internal traits that are otherwise invisible: memory, intelligence, imagination, vocabulary, and humor.

- The Payoff:
-- "Survival of the Wittiest": The prehistoric ancestors who could tell the best stories, make the funniest jokes, and explain the most complex ideas (the "Scheherazades" and "Cyranos") attracted the best mates. The "Homer Simpsons" of prehistory did not.
-- Fitness Indicator: Complex language is a reliable indicator of intelligence (g-factor), which is a major survival adaptation. By choosing an articulate mate, you are choosing a smart mate, ensuring better genes for your offspring.

- Solving the Sex Difference Problem:
-- The Challenge: Usually, sexual selection creates dimorphism (males display, females choose). Male birds sing; females don't. Why do human women talk as much as men?
-- The Solution: Mutual Mate Choice. Unlike most mammals, human males invest heavily in offspring (paternal investment). Therefore, men must be choosy too. They prefer smart, articulate women over dull, inarticulate ones. This mutual selection pressure kept language abilities roughly equal between the sexes.

- Solving the Altruism Problem:
-- The speaker isn't trying to be altruistic by giving away information; the speaker is showing off.
-- The "useful information" is just the medium for the display. I tell you the truth about the bison migration not because I care about your hunger, but because knowing the migration patterns proves I am smart, observant, and have a good memory—making me a desirable mate.
-- Virtue Signaling: This links directly to the book’s theme. Language allowed our ancestors to advertise their moral virtues (kindness, loyalty, intelligence) through words, creating the ultimate platform for virtue signaling.

Chapter IV: Sexual Selection for Moral Virtues

1. The Thesis: Goodness as a Reproductive Strategy

- The "Intellectual Heart": Miller identifies this essay as the deep-dive foundation of his worldview. While "virtue signaling" is often used as a pejorative for hypocrisy, this chapter explores the deep evolutionary roots of why we signal virtue at all.

- The Limitation of Traditional Models:
-- Standard evolutionary explanations for morality—Kin Selection (Hamilton), Reciprocal Altruism (Trivers), and Group Selection—are valid but insufficient.
-- The Deficit: These models explain basic cooperation (sharing food, warning calls), but they fail to explain the excess of human morality. Why are we so conspicuously generous to strangers? Why do we value "heroic" risks that offer no survival benefit? Why is morality so emotionally intense?

- The "Super-Charger" Effect:
-- Sexual selection acts as a biological amplifier. If a trait (e.g., sharing meat) is slightly useful for survival, sexual selection can seize upon it as a signal of competence.
-- Once a trait becomes attractive to mates, it enters a positive-feedback loop (Fisherian runaway), evolving to become far more elaborate, costly, and frequent than survival needs would dictate.
-- The Argument: Sexual selection did not create morality from scratch; it amplified standard primate social virtues (empathy, fairness) into uniquely complex human moral virtues.

2. The Three Signals: Genes, Parents, Partners
Miller categorizes moral virtues based on what specific information they convey to a potential mate.

- 1. Good Genes Indicators (The Genetic Warranty):
-- The Logic: A virtue signals that the carrier has a low "mutation load" (few genetic errors).
-- Mechanism: Building a complex brain capable of empathy, humor, and delicate social calibration is biologically difficult. It requires thousands of genes to work perfectly.
-- The Signal: A person who is conspicuously kind, funny, and socially adept is proving that their neuro-development was not derailed by mutations. This is a neurogenetic guarantee.
-- Prediction: These traits should be sexually attractive even for short-term mating (passing on genes) and should be most preferred by women at peak fertility (ovulation).

- 2. Good Parent Indicators (The Caretaker Warranty):
-- The Logic: A virtue signals the phenotypic ability to care for offspring.
-- The Signal: Traits like patience, protection, resource provisioning, and grooming. A genuinely empathic personality predicts that the mate will not neglect or abuse children.
-- Prediction: These traits do not need to be highly heritable; they just need to be reliable predictors of behavior. They are valued more in long-term mating.

- 3. Good Partner Indicators (The Coordination Warranty):
-- The Logic: A virtue signals the ability to function in a "mixed-motive game" (like marriage) without defecting.
-- The Signal: Conscientiousness and fidelity signal that the partner will play "cooperative" strategies in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma of marriage. Empathy signals that they attach positive utility to your happiness (they are not a psychopath).
-- Prediction: These are critical for long-term pair bonding but irrelevant for short-term flings.

3. Virtue Ethics & The "Moral Person"

- Act vs. Person:
-- Modern philosophy (utilitarianism/deontology) focuses on judging moral acts (e.g., "Is it right to pull the lever in the Trolley Problem?").
-- Evolutionary reality focuses on judging moral persons (e.g., "Is this guy a psychopath who will kill me in my sleep?").

- The Pleistocene Context:
-- Ancestral humans didn't judge isolated acts by strangers. They judged the character of people they lived with.
-- "Objectively Relational": Moral virtue is not an objective property of the universe (like mass), nor is it purely subjective (like ice cream preference). It is an emergent property of the interaction between the displayer's traits and the beholder's adaptations.

- Courtship as a Moral Obstacle Course:
-- Courtship is a ritualized test of character. We create situations (gift-giving, meeting the family, stressful travel) to probe the moral constitution of a potential mate.
-- The "Romantic" Virtues: The traits we find most sexually magnetic—kindness, bravery, honesty, loyalty—are identical to the traits praised by Aristotle, Confucius, and Aquinas. This is not a coincidence.
-- Vices as Turn-Offs: Moral vices (gluttony, sloth, cowardice, dishonesty) are sexually repulsive because they signal high mutation load, poor impulse control, or a propensity to defect in relationships.

4. Personality & Intelligence as Moral Signals
Miller argues that the standard traits measured by psychologists are actually moral/fitness indicators.

- The Big Five Personality Traits:
-- Conscientiousness: Signals reliability, health maintenance, and promise-keeping. Low conscientiousness predicts infidelity and early death.
-- Agreeableness: Signals warmth, kindness, and low aggression. High agreeableness is a "Good Partner" indicator.
-- Openness: A tricky one. High openness signals liberal/universalist morality; low openness signals loyalty/traditionalist morality. Both can be virtuous depending on the local culture.
-- Mental Illness: Conditions like Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissism, and Psychopathy are viewed as "moral failures" in the mating market because they destroy relationship stability.

- Intelligence ($g$ factor) as Virtue:
-- Intelligence is a "quasi-moral" status. High IQ correlates with patience (time-preference), cooperative behavior, and social sensitivity.
-- Virtue Epistemology: Wisdom, prudence, and intellectual honesty are cognitive virtues that rely on raw brainpower. To be a "good" person often requires being smart enough to understand the consequences of one's actions.

5. The 12 Predictions (The Scientific Checklist)
Miller outlines how to empirically test if a virtue is sexually selected. A trait is likely a sexually selected moral virtue if it shows:
1.  Positive Heritability: It runs in families (genes matter).
2.  Inbreeding Depression: The trait collapses in offspring of cousins/siblings (indicating it depends on "good genes").
3.  Elusive Genetics: You can't find a single "gene for kindness" because it depends on the health of the entire genome.
4.  Conspicuous Display: People show it off most aggressively during courtship (e.g., excessive tipping on a first date).
5.  Costliness (Condition-Dependence): It is hard to fake. Only healthy/stable people can maintain the virtue under stress.
6.  Comorbidity: Vices cluster together. (If you are impulsive, you are likely also aggressive and substance-dependent).
7.  Male Variance: Males show more extremes (more saints, more sinners) because of higher reproductive variance (the "risk-seeking" male strategy).
8.  Young Adult Peak: Virtue displays peak during the years of maximum mating effort (teens/20s).
9.  Alternative Strategies: Low-virtue individuals resort to coercion, deception, or sexual harassment.
10. Mate Preferences: People explicitly say they want these traits in a partner.
11. Assortative Mating: Kind people marry kind people; smart people marry smart people.
12. Sexual Derogation: We trash-talk rivals by attacking their moral character ("she's a slut," "he's a liar").

6. Implications for Normative Ethics

- The "Moral Alchemy" Problem:
-- Normative ethics tries to turn lead (unconscious, evolved, biased social instincts) into gold (universal, rational, consistent principles).
-- Miller argues this is destined to fail because our moral intuitions were not designed for consistency. They were designed for social pragmatism in small groups.

- Dual-Process Morality:
-- We have "Hot" morality (emotional judgments driven by mating/status) and "Cool" morality (rational principles).
-- The Sniper Dilemma:
-- Abstract Question: "Is it right to kill a tyrant?" (Cool morality: Debatable).
-- Mating Question: "Would you sleep with the handsome sniper who killed the tyrant with a difficult 800-meter shot?" (Hot morality: Yes, he has good genes, high status, and protects the tribe).

- Conclusion: We cannot trust our "gut instincts" on modern bioethical issues (cloning, abortion) because those instincts are fossilized mating preferences from the Pleistocene, not guides to cosmic truth.

Chapter V: The Google Memo

1. The Context: The Summer of Outrage (2017)

- The Precursor:
-- Miller describes the period of 2014–2016 as a tipping point where American academia drifted away from free speech principles.
-- The Signs: The administration at his own university claimed Public Law 92-318 (Title IX) took precedence over the First Amendment. There were behind-the-scenes maneuvers to prohibit provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking.
-- The "Safe Space" Expansion: Miller naively hoped this "censorious virtue signaling" was contained within the "social justice warrior" (SJW) culture of liberal arts colleges. He was shocked to see it conquer Google—one of the world’s most powerful companies, run by engineers.

- The Memo Event:
-- An anonymous software engineer (later revealed as James Damore) circulated a document titled "Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber."
-- The Thesis: Damore argued that the gender gap in tech was not solely due to sexism but was influenced by population-level biological differences in interests and traits (e.g., men favoring "things/systems," women favoring "people/feelings").

- The Backlash:
-- The "Matrix" Effect: Miller mocks the media response, noting how thousands of journalists transformed overnight into experts on evolutionary biology. He compares it to the scene in The Matrix where Trinity downloads the pilot program for a B-212 helicopter in seconds. "Such fast learners!"
-- The Credential Check: Google’s new VP of Diversity, Danielle Brown, criticized the memo for advancing "incorrect assumptions about gender." Miller wryly notes that her qualifications were a B.A. in Business and an M.B.A., which apparently qualified her to overrule a century of biological research.

2. Grading the Memo

- The Scientific Verdict:
-- Miller states unequivocally that almost all of Damore’s empirical claims were scientifically accurate.
-- The Grade: As a professor who has taught human sexuality for 28 years and written 100+ academic publications, Miller says he would give the memo an A- in a master’s level psychology course.
-- The Style: The memo was careful, dispassionate, and evidence-based—the opposite of a hate-speech rant.

- The "Blank Slate" Delusion:
-- Miller asserts that "Gender Feminism" is advocacy, not science. No gender feminist has ever been able to answer the question: "What empirical findings would convince you that psychological sex differences evolved?" Their unfalsifiable stance makes them ideologues, not researchers.

3. The Central Argument: The Equality/Diversity Paradox
Miller identifies a fatal logical flaw in the "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" (DEI) dogma that dominates corporate HR departments. The dogma rests on two core assumptions that are diametrically opposed.

- Assumption A (The Blank Slate):
-- "The human sexes and races have exactly the same minds, with precisely identical distributions of traits, aptitudes, interests, and motivations."
-- Implication: Any inequality of outcome (e.g., fewer female engineers) must be due to systemic discrimination/sexism.

- Assumption B (The Business Case for Diversity):
-- "The human sexes and races have such radically different minds, backgrounds, perspectives, and insights, that companies must increase their demographic diversity in order to be competitive."
-- Implication: Monocultures suffer from "groupthink"; diversity adds "cognitive variety."

- The Collision:
-- Scenario 1 (Assumption A is True): If all minds are functionally identical (interchangeable widgets), then a 100% male team functions exactly the same as a 50/50 team.
-- Result: Diversity provides zero competitive business advantage. The only reasons to pursue it are PR coverage, legal compliance, or moral vanity—not profit.
-- Scenario 2 (Assumption B is True): If demographic groups differ enough to provide unique business value (complementary quirks, different problem-solving styles), then they must differ psychologically.
-- Result: If they differ psychologically in skills/interests, we cannot expect equal outcomes in all job sectors. You cannot have "different enough to be useful" but "identical enough to be equally represented everywhere."

- The Ultimatum: "Equality or Diversity. You can't have both."
-- Psychological interchangeability (Blank Slate) makes diversity meaningless.
-- Psychological difference (Diversity) makes equal outcomes impossible.

4. Systematizers vs. Empathizers

- The Psychological Split: Miller uses Simon Baron-Cohen’s theory to explain the conflict.
-- The Diversity Industry: Populated by High Empathizers (HR, Media). They prioritize caring for feelings, protecting the vulnerable, and social cohesion. They view truth as secondary to kindness.
-- The Memo Author: Damore represents the High Systematizer (Engineers, Scientists). They prioritize logic, internal coherence, and evidence. They view truth as the ultimate good, regardless of feelings.

- Damore’s Fatal Error:
-- He tried to solve a moral/political problem using the "Systematizing" toolkit (facts/logic) in a culture run by "Empathizers."
-- He explicitly called for "de-moralizing diversity"—treating it as an engineering problem rather than a crusade for justice. To an Empathizer, this sounds like sociopathy; to a Systematizer, it sounds like the only way to actually fix anything.

5. The Path Forward

- Facing Reality:
-- Miller argues that American businesses must abandon the "social construction" delusion if they want to remain competitive in a global market. Reality dictates that biological differences exist.
-- The Twist: Evolutionary psychology actually supports the case for diversity. Because men and women have "intricately complementary quirks," mixed-sex teams are likely more effective than mono-sex teams.
-- The Cost: Accepting this means accepting that perfect parity (50/50 representation in every department) is a utopian fantasy. Companies must choose: Do they want the competitive advantage of real diversity, or do they want the aesthetic comfort of statistical equality? They cannot have both.

Chapter VI: The Neurodiversity Case for Free Speech

1. The Isaac Newton Thought Experiment

- The Scenario: Imagine young Isaac Newton travels from 1670s England to 2017 Harvard to teach undergraduates.
-- Newton’s Profile: Obsessive, paranoid, bad stutter, unstable moods, psychotic mania/depression (likely Asperger’s/Bipolar).

- The Modern Conflict:
-- The Speech Code: He is subject to Harvard’s "Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion," which prohibits "disrespect for the dignity of others."
-- The Platform: His literary agent demands he build a Twitter following of 20k to sell the Principia Mathematica.

- The Result: Newton fails immediately. He airs eccentric views on alchemy, Biblical cryptography, and the Apocalypse. He is reported by students for "offensive" speech.
-- The Trade-off: We get a fresh controversy to virtue signal about on HuffPost and Jezebel, but we lose the Laws of Motion.
-- The Point: Censorship doesn’t just kill ideas; it drives away the kind of people (eccentrics) who generate paradigm-shifting ideas.

2. Miller’s Personal "Coming Out"

- The "Aspie" Identity:
-- Miller identifies as having high-functioning Asperger’s (though no longer a separate DSM diagnosis).
-- Childhood markers: More interested in things than people; played chess silently; obsessed with science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons; designed submarines/spacecraft with drafting equipment; hated eye contact until college.
-- Social Strategy: Success in friendship/mating was "despite my social skills, not because of them." He had to intellectually train himself to perform nonverbal communication.

- The Damore Connection:
-- When James Damore (Google Memo author) was fired, Miller felt an immediate emotional kinship. Damore reminded him of his best friends and himself: someone writing with "careful scientific style and moral earnestness" who was punished for missing social cues.
-- The Realization: Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) pay lip service to "diversity" but aggressively persecute neurodiversity.

3. The "Neurotypicality Assumption"

- The Flaw in Speech Codes: Speech codes are written by "normal" brains for "normal" brains. They rely on a false model of human nature that assumes everyone on campus is capable, 100% of the time, of:
-- Deciphering Vagueness: Understanding euphemisms like "unwelcome verbal behavior" or "bias acts."
-- Theory of Mind: Predicting with 100% accuracy what might offend a stranger of a different race, gender, or religion.
-- Inhibition: possessing perfect self-control to suppress "inappropriate" thoughts in all contexts.

- Scientific Reality: Traits like verbal intelligence, social sensitivity, and impulse control are heritable and variable. Requiring a neurodivergent person to have "neurotypical" social skills is like requiring a paraplegic to use the stairs.

4. The Varieties of Neurodiversity (The 20%)
Miller argues that restrictive speech norms affect at least 20% of the campus population (more than many protected demographic minorities). He breaks down specific conditions incompatible with speech codes:

- Autism Spectrum (Asperger’s): Impaired ability to read social cues or understand "unwritten rules." High prevalence in STEM fields.

- ADHD (3%): High impulsivity; tendency to "blurt out" inappropriate comments before the brain’s censor can catch them.

- Tourette Syndrome (1%): Irresistible compulsions to say obscene or derogatory things (coprolalia).

- PTSD (8%): Hypersensitivity to triggers; can provoke reactive anger and "offensive" verbal aggression.

- Bipolar Disorder (4%): Manic phases lead to eccentric beliefs, lack of inhibition, and hyper-sexuality (violating sexual harassment norms).

- Schizophrenia Spectrum (5%): Unusual communication styles and "eccentric views" that fall outside the Overton Window.

- Cluster A & B Personality Disorders: Paranoid, Narcissistic, and Borderline personalities involve social awkwardness or attention-seeking behaviors that violate norms.

- Transient Neurodiversity: Sleep deprivation, low blood sugar, caffeine, or Ritalin can temporarily impair social filters in anyone.

5. Systematizers vs. Empathizers (The Culture War)

- The Baron-Cohen Model:
-- Systematizing: The drive to analyze rules, evidence, and procedures. Dominant in males, autistics, and STEM.
-- Empathizing: The ability to understand feelings and respond with "appropriate" emotion. Dominant in females and Humanities.

- The Conflict:
-- Speech codes are the weaponization of Empathizing against Systematizing.
-- The "EQ" Test: Items on the Empathy Quotient scale (e.g., "I can tune into how someone else feels rapidly") essentially measure one's ability to follow a speech code. Aspies score low (Miller scores 14/80).

- The "Time Travel Paradox": Codes prohibit "unwelcome" jokes. To an Aspie, this is a paradox: How can you know a joke is "unwelcome" until after you tell it and receive feedback? They cannot predict the future state of the listener's mind.

- Logical Inconsistency: Systematizers are driven crazy by the double standards of PC culture (e.g., it’s okay to insult "toxic masculinity" but not the "wage gap"; okay to mock Catholics but not Muslims). To a Systematizer, a rule must be universal to be valid.

6. Disparate Impact & The "Chilling Effect"

- Legal Concept: "Disparate Impact" occurs when a formally neutral policy adversely affects a legally protected group. Since mental disorders are protected under the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), speech codes that punish the neurodivergent are illegal.

- The Reality of Fear:
-- The Grad Student: A social science student avoids teaching "Human Sexuality" for fear of making an off-the-cuff remark and being destroyed.
-- The STEM PhD: Seeing scientists like Matt Taylor (the "shirtstorm" incident) or Tim Hunt destroyed for trivial/fictional offenses, the Aspie male leaves academia for a tech startup.
-- The "Frozen Wasteland": Neurodivergent academics withdraw from social life (dinners, parties) to avoid accidental offense. This destroys the "life of the mind," which relies on vigorous, risky debate.

- The Suicide of Will Moore: Miller cites the tragedy of Will Moore, a political science professor with high-functioning autism who killed himself in 2017. His suicide note cited the exhaustion of trying to navigate social offenses and accidentally offending colleagues.

7. Conclusion: The Sword of Damocles

- The Weapon: Restrictive speech norms hang like a Sword of Damocles over every brain that works differently. The neurodivergent feel the weight of it every day, bracing for moral outrage they cannot predict.

- The Call to Action:
-- Neurodiversity must be reclaimed as a civil rights issue.
-- Legal Warfare: Miller suggests using the Department of Education and federal district courts to challenge speech codes as ADA violations.
-- The Goal: Restore academia as a "safe space" for eccentric thought—a haven where thinking the unthinkable and saying the unsayable is protected, not punished. "Newton must be welcomed back to academia."

Chapter VII: The Cultural Diversity Case for Free Speech

1. Origin: The "This is Library" Moment

- The Inspiration:
-- After writing about genetic neurodiversity (Asperger’s), Miller considered cultural neurodiversity—the cognitive differences resulting from being raised in a foreign culture.
-- The Viral Catalyst: He recalls the viral 2017 video "Hey, hey, hey THIS IS LIBRARY!", where an Asian student at the University of Washington shouts down a group of noisy Social Justice Warrior (SJW) protesters interrupting his study time.
-- The Realization: To a student from a culture that values academic discipline and authority (like China), the noisy "virtue signaling" of American activism looks not like justice, but like rude, chaotic narcissism.

2. The Demographic Reality

- The Numbers: Foreigners are not a fringe minority in American academia; they are the backbone of the hard sciences.
-- Engineering PhDs: In 2004, 55% of engineering doctoral students in the US were foreign.
-- STEM Grads: In 2011, 28% of all graduate students in science, engineering, and health were foreign.
-- Top Origins: China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia.

- The "Bait and Switch":
-- Foreigners are attracted to the US because it markets itself as the bastion of the First Amendment, political liberty, and open sexuality. They often flee repressive regimes (China, Saudi Arabia) or restrictive democracies (Germany, UK) expecting a "promised land of free inquiry."
-- The Reality: Instead of freedom, they encounter a "dizzying minefield" of speech codes, "intellectual tripwires," and "hair-trigger taboo sensors."
-- The Irony: The "repressive" regimes they left often had clear, stable rules about what could not be said (e.g., "Don't criticize the King/Party"). American campuses have unstable, shifting rules that change with every news cycle.

3. The Culture Gap & Implicit Knowledge

- The Challenge of Switching Cultures:
-- Miller’s Experience: Even moving to culturally similar nations (UK, Germany, Australia), Miller struggled with invisible taboos (e.g., British class anxieties, German sensitivity about "fascism," Australian guilt over Aboriginal history).
-- The Faculty Problem: Miller’s department hired European faculty who struggled to understand the nuance of terms like "illegal" vs. "undocumented" or "transsexual" vs. "transgender." There is no "manual" for American PC culture because the norms are often unspoken identifiers of in-group status.

- The Impossible Standard:
-- Speech codes require students to be "respectful" and "inoffensive."
-- The Trap: "Being inoffensive" assumes the speaker has already mastered the implicit knowledge of American ideological norms. A foreigner cannot "read between the lines" of a vague policy if they don't know the cultural context.
-- Examples:
-- A Saudi student taking the Quran literally regarding women.
-- A Chinese student believing Xi Jinping’s authority is superior to messy democracy.
-- An Indian student seeing nothing wrong with arranged marriages.
-- These views are authentic "diversity," yet expressing them constitutes a violation of the "Respectful Campus" policy.

4. The Media Failure (Hollywood vs. Reality)

- The Distorted Mirror: Foreign students form their expectations of American college life through exported pop culture.
-- Movies: They watch Marvel superheroes (apolitical action) or comedies like Animal House and Old School, which depict universities as places of wild, offensive freedom where the "stuffy administrator" is the villain.
-- Pornhub: Stats show high traffic from conservative countries (India, Saudi Arabia). Students may assume American mating norms resemble the aggressive/performative sex seen in porn.
-- The Shock: They arrive expecting American Pie but encounter Title IX tribunals and "Affirmative Consent" workshops. They expect a culture of libertinism but find a culture of "sex-negativity" and bureaucratic policing of romance.

- The Information Gap: Unless a foreign student watches Jordan Peterson or reads Quillette, they have zero exposure to the concept of "identity politics" or "microaggressions" before arriving.

5. The Paradox of Foreign Student Groups

- The "Oasis":
-- Universities host clubs like the "Chinese Language and Culture Club" or "Turkish Student Association." These serve as oases of cultural familiarity where students relax into their home norms.

- The Legal Grey Zone:
-- The Question: Do American speech codes apply at a Brazilian Student Association party? Can they tell risqué jokes or flirt according to Brazilian norms?
-- The Dilemma: If universities enforce American PC norms on these groups, they destroy the "diversity" of the group. If they don't enforce them, they admit that speech codes are arbitrary and discriminatory when applied to American students.
-- The Mormon Example: If the "Latter-Day Saint Student Association" wants to court according to 1950s Utah norms, do they have less right to do so than the "Harvard College Munch" (BDSM) club negotiating consent via safe words?
-- Conclusion: True diversity requires Freedom of Association, which must include the freedom to set one's own speech norms within the group.

6. The Consequences of Alienation

- 1. Financial Suicide:
-- Foreign students contributed $30 billion to the US economy in 2015, often paying full tuition. Making them miserable with "confusing speech codes" and "terrifying sexual misconduct policies" is bad business. They will eventually take their money to universities in countries that treat them like adults.

- 2. Geopolitical Blowback:
-- US universities train the global elite. The brightest students from China and India will return home to become scientists, billionaires, and leaders.
-- The Impression: If they leave America viewing it as a land of "repression, sanctimony, and over-sensitivity" rather than liberty, American soft power collapses. We are teaching them that "Western Freedom" is a hypocritical sham.

- 3. The Ethical Imperative:
-- Foreign students are people. Utilitarian ethics demand we treat their well-being as equal to that of American students.
-- The Verdict: American universities are currently failing to uphold the basic human rights (free speech, freedom of conscience) of their most vulnerable guests in the name of "inclusion."
