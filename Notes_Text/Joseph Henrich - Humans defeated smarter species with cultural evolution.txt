Joseph Henrich on Humans defeated smarter species with cultural evolution

Summary:
Joseph Henrich argues that human success is not defined by raw individual intelligence, but by the "Collective Brain"—our unique ability to accumulate culture over generations. He explains how 70,000 years ago, cultural "packages" allowed humans to expand violently across the globe. He details the counter-intuitive history of the West, arguing that the Catholic Church’s accidental dismantling of tribal kinship structures created the specific psychological conditions (WEIRD) necessary for the Industrial Revolution. The discussion moves to the decline of human brain size, the specific mechanics of "blind" cultural transmission (e.g., cassava processing), and the implications of AI as a massive acceleration of social learning that risks eliminating necessary "noise" and serendipity.

1. The Human Expansion & The "Startup Problem"

- The 70,000 Year Puzzle:
-- Genetic evidence (David Reich) shows a massive expansion of one human group (~1,000–10,000 people) from the Near East 70,000 years ago, replacing other hominids (Neanderthals, Denisovans).
-- The False Assumption: We often assume this was due to a genetic leap (IQ/Brain size). However, Neanderthals had larger brains.
-- The "Package" Theory: The advantage was likely a "cultural package" (institutions + technology). Just as the Inuit expanded across the Arctic by combining bows, dogs, sleds, and whaling boats (while exterminating the Dorset people), the ancestral humans likely possessed a superior suite of social technologies (projectile weapons + tighter social interconnectedness).

- The "Startup" Threshold:
-- The Brain Cost: Big brains are metabolically expensive. In a world with no accumulated culture, a big brain is a waste—you should trust instinct. You only need a big brain for social learning if there is something worth learning.
-- Crossing the Valley: How did humans cross the threshold where culture became valuable enough to justify the brain?
        1.  Environmental Fluctuation: The climate changed rapidly 2.5 million years ago. If the world changes too fast, genes move too slow; if it changes moderately, social learning is superior to instinct.
        2.  Ground-Dwelling: Having hands allowed for tool use.
        3.  Group Size: Savanna predation forced ancestors into large groups. Larger groups = higher probability of someone inventing something useful, making the "download" of culture more valuable.

- Expansion & Replacement Cycles: Human history is a series of these expansions: 
-- Bantu Expansion (5,000 YA): Replaced hunter-gatherer populations across Africa. 
-- Austronesian Expansion: The peopling of the Pacific. 
-- Neolithic Expansion: Farmers moving into Europe. 
-- Australian Expansion (6,000 YA): A group from Northern Australia expanded to cover 7/8ths of the continent. 
-- Their "tech" was social: Linguistic Exogamy (rules forcing you to marry someone who speaks a different language) and large-scale initiation rituals. This forced tribes to congregate for months, facilitating technology transfer and preventing cultural loss.
-- The Inuit vs. The Dorset (Case Study): 
-- The Inuit expanded out of Alaska across the Arctic to Greenland. 
-- The Inuit Package: Bows, dogs, sleds, large whaling boats, and social interconnectedness. 
-- The Dorset Collapse: The existing population (Dorset) lacked this package. Crucially, the Dorset had lost technology over time. As they spread out, their languages diversified, they lost contact with one another, and their "Collective Brain" fragmented. Without a large network, they couldn't maintain complex tools, leading to their eventual extermination by the Inuit.

2. The "Collective Brain" & Declining Intelligence

- The Feral Camel vs. The Lost Explorer:
-- European explorers in Australia often died of starvation despite being surrounded by food, while their escaped camels thrived.
-- Reason: Camels have innate instincts (smelling water, detoxifying food). Humans have externalized these functions to culture. We cannot detoxify food biologically; we do it through cooking and processing techniques passed down culturally.

- The Wheel Anomaly in the New World: 
-- The Puzzle: Why no wheels in the Americas? It wasn't lack of animals (dogs and llamas can pull carts) or lack of concept (Mayan toys had wheels). 
-- The Explanation: The New World had a smaller, disconnected Collective Brain. Eurasia is oriented East-West (similar latitudes/climates), allowing ideas to flow from China to Spain ("The Lucky Latitudes"). The Americas are North-South, creating climatic barriers that stopped innovations from spreading and accumulating.

- Brain Size Decline:
-- The Trend: Human brain size has been shrinking for the last 10,000–20,000 years. We have fewer neurons and less raw computational power than our ancestors.
-- The Ant Analogy: As with ants, when a species develops specialized castes and a "superorganism" structure, individual brain size drops.
-- Specialization: In a complex society, individuals do not need to know how to do everything (hunt, build, heal). We offload cognitive load to the "Collective Brain." We are becoming smarter as a species, but dumber as individuals.

3. Epistemic Hell & Chesterton’s Fence

- The Cassava Protocol:
-- Bitter cassava contains cyanide. To eat it safely requires a tedious, multi-day processing method.
-- The Trap: If you skip steps, you don't die immediately; you get goiters and chronic poisoning years later. There is no immediate feedback loop to tell you that you are wrong.
-- Faith > Reason: Ancestral humans did not understand why the process worked. They followed it because it was custom. Societies that developed strong taboos ("Do this or the gods will punish you") survived. Those that used "reason" ("I don't see why I need to wait 3 days") died out.
-- Implication: Cultural evolution often requires the abdication of reason. You survive by blindly copying the successful traits of elders/high-prestige individuals.

- The Fidelity of Transmission:
-- Cultural evolution works like natural selection but requires time. It can pick up on small advantages (e.g., adding spices for antimicrobial properties) but requires 1,000 years of selection pressure to become a strong signal.

4. The Origins of WEIRD Psychology

- Defining WEIRD: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic. This psychological profile is a global outlier: highly individualistic, analytical (vs. holistic), high trust in strangers, low conformity.

- The Church as the Catalyst:
-- The Mechanism: The Western Church (later Catholic) systematically dismantled intensive kinship (clans/tribes).
-- The Bans: The Church banned cousin marriage (out to the 6th cousin), polygyny, and non-genetic kinship/adoption.
-- The Motive: This was likely accidental or driven by greed. By breaking clan lines and allowing inheritance by testament (rather than corporate tribal ownership), the Church became the primary beneficiary of land bequests.

- The Result (The Great Divergence):
-- Mobility: Without a clan to tie you to the land, people became mobile.
-- Voluntary Associations: To survive without a tribe, Europeans invented guilds, universities, and charter towns. These are communities of strangers bound by shared rules/oaths rather than blood.
-- Psychological Shift: This environment selected for "impersonal prosociality" (trusting people you don't know) and individualism.

- Comparison to China/India:
-- China: Maintained strong clan structures. Even when moving to cities, Chinese migrants maintained "enclaves" tied to their ancestral village. The "network of minds" remained siloed by kin.
-- India: The caste system (genetic and social segregation) created extreme silos. Even if a specific caste had a breakthrough, it could not easily diffuse to the rest of the population.

5. The Industrial Revolution & Innovation

- Why Europe?
-- Europe had a "Collective Brain" advantage due to the flow of ideas.
-- The Bishopric Metric: Historical data shows that as a region falls under the influence of a Bishopric (Church administration), intensive kinship declines, and centuries later, the production of "creative" individuals and patents rises.
-- Rebuttal to Genetic Theories: Unlike Gregory Clark (who argues for genetic changes in patience/thrift), Henrich argues these traits are culturally learned. Migrants to the US assimilate these traits within 2-3 generations, which is too fast for genetics.

- The "Great Man" Myth (Einstein):
-- Einstein was not a singular genius operating in a vacuum. He was part of the "Olympia Academy" reading group, which had consumed all the relevant literature on relativity.
-- As a patent clerk, Einstein was specifically evaluating devices for synchronizing trains across Europe—literally the practical application of "relative time."
-- Simultaneous Discovery: Poincaré had the same equations as Einstein at the same time but lacked the specific conceptual framework to interpret them as radical reality rather than mathematical "fudge factors."
-- Context Matters: Innovation is the recombination of existing ideas within a well-connected collective brain.
-- Cultural Transmission: If your same-sex parent has a patent in a specific field (e.g., synthetic adhesives), you are 9x more likely to patent in that exact field. 
-- Silicon Valley vs. Boston: A kid from Silicon Valley (tech culture) who moves to NY will likely patent in computers. A kid from Boston (biotech culture) who moves to NY will likely patent in biotech. Culture overrides geography.

6. AI and the Future of the Collective Brain

- The AI Advantage:
-- AI represents a phase shift in social learning. AI can copy knowledge instantly (high fidelity) and maintain a "context window" that encompasses the entire internet (unlike humans, who are limited).
-- The "Tasmanian" Risk: Humans in isolation (like Tasmanians) lose technology. AIs, by holding all context simultaneously, avoid this "drift."

- The "Noise" Problem:
-- Serendipity: Much of human innovation comes from errors in transmission or serendipitous meetings (e.g., people meeting at coffee shops in Silicon Valley).
-- Homogeneity Risk: If AI allows for perfect, instant transmission, we risk a "monoculture" that lacks the necessary variation for evolutionary selection.
-- Cultural "Mutational Load": Without the external pressure of war or existential threats (which historically pruned inefficient institutions), modern societies (and potentially AI societies) might suffer from institutional sclerosis/decay.

7. Modern Challenges: Fertility & Stagnation

- The Fertility Crisis:
-- WEIRD culture (individualism + female education + labor participation) is currently selecting for extinction via low birth rates.
-- The Future is Religious: Cultural evolution favors groups that reproduce. The future likely belongs to pro-natalist religious groups (Amish, Mormons, Haredi) who have successfully immunized themselves against the anti-fertility memes of modernity.

- Institutional Decay:
-- Cancer Analogy: Bureaucracies naturally corrode from the inside.
-- The Solution: We need "Programmed Cell Death" for government agencies. Institutions should have sunset clauses where they are automatically dismantled and rebuilt to force renewal.

8. Methodology & Philosophy

- Spaghetti Theory of Assimilation: Immigrants assimilate to the host, but the host also assimilates the immigrant (e.g., Italian food). However, "Social Interactional Traits" (like low trust) are different from cuisine. We want diversity in food/ideas, but high variance in "trust" can be destructive (e.g., mafias).

- Interdisciplinary Approach: Henrich’s work combines anthropology, psychology, economics, and biology because academic silos prevent understanding complex systems like human history.

- Chesterton's Meta-Fence: A counter-argument that perhaps the modern "tradition" of tearing down fences (rapid progress) is itself a successful adaptation that we should trust, rather than fearing progress. Henrich advises caution: we can tear down fences, but we must understand that rituals and "irrational" beliefs often perform heavy lifting for social cohesion that we cannot easily replace with logic.
