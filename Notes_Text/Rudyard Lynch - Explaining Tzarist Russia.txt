Rudyard Lynch on Explaining Tzarist Russia

Summary:
Rudyard Lynch analyzes the history of Tsarist Russia as a "PTSD civilization" forged by the trauma of the Mongol conquest. He argues that Russia is one of three European "frontiers" (alongside the US and Latin America) that evolved into an extreme version of the continent's autocratic tendencies. The discussion details the destruction of early Russian democracy by the Mongols, the rise of the "Service Nobility" under Ivan the Terrible, the paradox of "Land Pirate" Cossacks spreading slavery while seeking freedom, and the cultural schizophrenia introduced by Peter the Great. Lynch concludes that the Tsarist system collapsed not because it failed to modernize, but because its Mongol-style autocracy could not manage the logistics of 20th-century industrial warfare.

1. The Frontier Theory: Russia as the "Extreme" Europe

- The Three Frontiers: Lynch posits that European civilization expanded into three major frontiers, each producing a different anthropological result based on how they handled land and labor:
    1.  North America: Settled by the English; became a Republican Democracy based on universal freedom (eventually abolishing slavery).
    2.  Latin America: Settled by the Spanish; became a Caste Society run by small, oppressive elites.
    3.  Russia: The Eastern frontier; became an Autocratic Slave State that effectively turned the entire population into property of the government.

- Anthropological "Purification": Colonies or frontier societies often represent the furthest, most "purified" extension of the home culture's traits. Lynch argues America is "more English than England" (in its libertarian instincts), and Russia pushed the European tendency toward centralized autocracy to its absolute, most terrifying logical conclusion.

- The "Tiger Park" Reality: Unlike the US, which was isolated by oceans, Russia is in the middle of the map without natural borders. Lynch compares Russia's history to "living next to a nature park for tigers." When tigers (Mongols, Turks, Swedes, French, Germans) periodically eat your village, you develop a hyper-militarized, paranoid governance structure just to survive.

2. Origins: The Viking/Greek Synthesis

- The Varangian Foundation: Russia was not established by Slavs alone but by Vikings (Varangians) who utilized the river systems to trade between Scandinavia and the Byzantine/Islamic worlds. They conquered the local Slavic population and established Kievan Rus.

- The Religious Choice: Early Rus' had a critical choice regarding state religion. They rejected Judaism (Khazars) and Islam (Volga Bulgars) and chose Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
-- The Reason: Their primary trade partner was the Byzantine Empire.
-- The Consequence: This made Russia a "Hyper-Christian" society. Lynch notes that 70% of high-ranking medieval clergy were ethnic Greeks. This tied Russia's intellectual development to the "Oriental" tradition of the East (mysticism and state subservience) rather than the West (where the conflict between Pope and King bred rational inquiry and legalism).

- The "Lost" Potential: Before the Mongols, Russia was actually more free than Western Europe.
-- Novgorod: A wealthy merchant republic in the North with property rights and democratic elements.
-- Peasantry: Russian peasants in the medieval period were free farmers, whereas Western peasants were serfs. The trajectory was towards a society like America, until the Mongols arrived.

3. The Mongol Trauma: The "Tatar Yoke"

- Demographic Apocalypse: The Mongol conquest is the defining trauma of Russian history. Lynch notes the Mongols killed roughly 100 million people globally when the world population was only 500 million. This scale of death left a permanent scar on the Russian psyche.

- The "Herder" Mindset: The Mongols were nomadic herders. They did not view farmers as human beings with rights, but as cattle (sheep or cows) to be milked for tax or slaughtered at will. This dehumanization became the blueprint for the Russian state's relationship with its own people.

- The Rise of Moscow (The Collaborators): Moscow rose from obscurity not through bravery, but subservience. Moscow became the Tax Collector for the Khan.
-- The Mechanism: The Mongols gave Moscow the authority to crush other Russian principalities to extract tribute. Moscow learned governance from the Mongols, adopting their absolute autocracy.

- The "Great Wall of Russia": A forgotten historical fact is that Russia built a massive fortification line (200-500 miles long) on the southern border to stop Tatar raids. For centuries, the Tatars (Mongol remnants in Crimea/Kazan) raided Russia, enslaving millions of Russians to sell in Islamic slave markets. This constant threat of abduction necessitated a total-war state.

4. The "Service Nobility" and State Slavery

- Ivan the Terrible & The Soviet Movies:
-- Ivan IV destroyed the old hereditary nobility (boyars) and created a new class dependent entirely on the Tsar.
-- The Digression: Lynch mentions that Soviet films about Ivan the Terrible (by Eisenstein) are worth watching for the battles alone. Because the Soviet state owned the economy, they didn't use CGI; they used the actual Red Army. For the Siege of Kazan scene, they built a real fortress and blew it up with real explosives, using 30,000 extras.

- The "Service Nobility": unlike the West, where nobles had independent power bases (land/castles), Russian nobles were political appointments. Their status was contingent on serving the bureaucracy or military. If they failed, they lost everything.
-- The Psychology: Even the highest Russian nobles signed letters to the Tsar as "Your Humble Slave."

- Serfdom as Chattel Slavery:
-- Lynch clarifies that Russian serfdom was distinct from Western feudalism. In the West, serfdom was a contract (labor for protection). In Russia, it was Chattel Slavery.
-- Brutality: Families were broken up and sold. Landlords kept "harems" of serf girls. Nobles could exile serfs to Siberia for "accidental eye contact."
-- The Statistic: By the 18th century, 80% of the Russian population were slaves.

5. Expansion: Cossacks and the "Land Pirates"

- The Paradox of Expansion: The Russian Empire—a slave state—was ironically expanded by people seeking freedom.

- The Cossacks: Runaway serfs fled to the "Wild Fields" (Ukraine/Southern Russia). They adopted the Mongol lifestyle—living on horseback and forming democratic military brotherhoods.

- The "Czarist Deal": The government struck a deal with the Cossacks: "We won't enslave you if you conquer land for us."

- The Conquest of Siberia:
-- Driven by the Fur Trade (the "oil" of the 17th century), Cossacks conquered from the Urals to the Pacific (12 time zones) in just 50 years.
-- Violence: They brutally wiped out native tribes to secure furs.
-- American Encounter: Russia colonized Alaska and established Fort Ross outside San Francisco. The Spanish settled California largely to block the Russian advance down the coast.

- The Betrayal: Eventually, once the land was secure, the State broke its promise and enslaved the Cossacks too, closing the loop on freedom.

6. Westernization: The Schizophrenic Empire

- Peter the Great: The pivotal figure who realized Russia was technologically backward compared to the West.
-- The Grand Embassy: Peter traveled undercover as a shipwright in the Netherlands to learn Western tech.
-- Westernization by Force: He forced nobles to shave beards, dress in French clothes, and speak French/German.

- The Great Cultural Divorce: This created a tiny, hyper-westernized elite (the world of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky) sitting on top of a massive, medieval Slavic population. The two groups literally could not understand each other, sowing the seeds for the 1917 Revolution.

- Defeating Sweden: Peter reformed the military and crushed the "Teenage Commander" Charles XII of Sweden at the Battle of Poltava. This ended Sweden's status as a superpower and established Russia as a permanent European Great Power.

- Salami Slicing Poland: Russia, Austria, and Prussia slowly dismantled Poland-Lithuania. Poland had been the most democratic country in the world (12% voting franchise vs Britain's 3%), but its weak central government made it easy prey. Russia absorbed millions of Poles, Jews, and Ukrainians, complicating its internal demographics.

7. The 19th Century: Zenith and Humiliation

- 1812 (The Peak): Russia reached its geopolitical zenith by destroying Napoleon’s Grand Army. Russian troops occupying Paris in 1814 created a "Russian Panic" in the West—the fear of a limitless, disciplined Slavic behemoth.

- The Crimean War (The Wake-Up Call):
-- In the 1850s, Britain and France invaded Crimea.
-- Tech Gap: The Industrial Revolution allowed Western powers to project power thousands of miles away better than Russia could within its own borders. Russia realized that Willpower + Serfdom could no longer beat Steamships + Rifles.

- The Reform Era:
-- Stung by defeat, the Tsars showed genuine foresight. Alexander II abolished serfdom (1861) and kickstarted capitalism.
-- The Myth of Communism: Lynch argues the Tsars modernized Russia, not the Communists. By 1900, Russia had the fastest-growing industry in Europe. The Communists hijacked this growth and stunted it with trauma.

8. The Collapse: Incompetence and World War I

- Russo-Japanese War (1905):
-- A "White" power lost to an Asian power for the first time in the modern era.
-- Incompetence: Lynch cites anecdotes where Japanese spies worked as janitors in Russian forts in China. They saw every secret weapon and map, while Russian officers were blinded by their own bureaucracy and regulations.

- World War I (The End):
-- The Autocratic system required a genius at the top to function. Nicholas II was mediocre.
-- Logistical Failure: The system could not feed its own soldiers or produce rifles. Millions of untrained peasants were sent into the meat grinder.
-- The Revolution: The collapse was not ideological but a systemic failure of the "Mongol-style" autocracy to function in the complexity of the industrial age.

9. Key Takeaways on Russian Psychology

- The "Blackpill" History: Lynch agrees with his father's sentiment that reading Russian history is depressing because there are no "fun parts." It is a cycle of invasion, slavery, and tyranny.

- Ukraine vs. Russia: Lynch frames this as the "Confederacy" problem. Ukraine (Little Russia) has a distinct frontier culture (Cossack/Polish influence), but Russia views it as an integral part of the imperial core. Russia believes it cannot be an empire without Ukraine.

- Submission to Authority: The Russian peasantry endured centuries of abuse because the State/Church convinced them that suffering was holy and necessary to protect "Mother Russia" from the hostile world.

10. Book Recommendations

- "A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia" by David Christian (Lynch considers this the best, viewing Russia through the lens of Inner Eurasia).

- "A People's Tragedy" by Orlando Figes (Narrative history of the Revolution and the society that produced it).

- "War and Peace and War" by Peter Turchin (Structural-demographic theory applied to Russian expansion).

- "The Rise of the West" by William H. McNeill (Contextualizes the steppe frontier dynamics).
