Summary: 
A strategic manifesto arguing that Wokism (the crusade to eliminate disparities) is the inevitable result of the "Equality Thesis" (the belief that all groups have equal innate potential). Cofnas argues that "Soft Realism" (cultural explanations) fails because it is empirically false and leads back to blaming whites. The only solution is a "Hereditarian Revolution"—convincing the elites that race differences are genetic. The essay rebuts objections about political feasibility, linguistics ("Race" vs. "Population"), and the supposed danger of "Hard Realism."

### **1. The Core Diagnosis: Why Wokism Persists**
*   **The Root Cause:** Wokism is what happens when you combine **Christian Morality** with the **Equality Thesis** (the belief that all groups have equal innate distribution of traits).
    *   *The Logic:* If all groups are equal, then any disparity *must* be caused by environmental oppression (racism/sexism). Therefore, the moral imperative is to crusade against these hidden forces.
*   **The Failure of "Soft Realism" (Sowellism):**
    *   Conservatives (like Thomas Sowell) argue disparities are due to "Culture."
    *   *Objection 1 (Empirical):* It is scientifically false. The same patterns of racial disparity (Africans < Europeans < East Asians) appear globally, regardless of local culture. Culture is a *downstream effect* of genetics, not an independent variable.
    *   *Objection 2 (The Trap):* Even if "culture" were the cause, the Left would simply ask: "Who destroyed black culture?" The answer leads back to white racism (slavery/colonialism), returning us to Wokism.
*   **The Failure of Legal Reform (Hanania/Rufo):**
    *   Richard Hanania argues we can use law to enforce colorblindness and live with "cognitive dissonance" regarding the lack of black representation.
    *   *Cofnas’s Rebuttal:* In a true meritocracy, black representation at Harvard would drop to **0.7%**. Blacks would vanish from all high-profile positions (except sports/entertainment). The Woke Elite would never accept this "cognitive dissonance"; they would launch a counter-revolution. You cannot win without the elites.

### **2. The Strategy: Hereditarianism (Hard Realism)**
*   **The Ace up the Sleeve:** Hereditarianism has one major advantage over Soft Realism: **It is true.**
    *   Elites (who are high-IQ) are responsive to truth if the taboo is broken.
    *   *Historical Precedent:* Darwinism was "confessing a murder" in 1844 but mainstream by 1882. Gay Marriage went from 35% to 71% support in 20 years. Elites shift quickly when the empirical premise rots.
*   **The "Information Campaign":**
    *   We do not need a presidential speech (Michael Levin’s fantasy).
    *   We need to target the **Intellectual Elites**. Wokism started with elites in the 1950s and trickled down. Hereditarianism must do the same.
    *   *The Goal:* Creating a "critical mass" of elites who reject the Equality Thesis destroys the moral justification for Wokism.

### **3. Rebutting Objections to "Race"**
*   **The Semantic Trap:** Critics (Charles Murray, Lorenzo Warby) argue we should drop the word "Race" for "Population" or "Ancestry" to avoid baggage.
*   **Cofnas’s Defense of "Race":**
    *   **Scientific Validity:** "Race" corresponds to "Genetic Cluster Membership" with **99.86% accuracy** (self-report matches DNA).
    *   **The "Clines" Fallacy:** Just because races blend at the edges (clines) doesn't mean they don't exist. Languages blend into dialects, but "English" and "Mandarin" are still distinct.
    *   **Chimpanzee Comparison:** Warby claims chimps have races but humans don't. This is arbitrary. Templeton’s "25% threshold" for race is an invented metric not used in standard taxonomy.
    *   **Regression to the Mean:** Warby argues Nigerian immigrants have high achievement due to culture. Cofnas counters that their children regress to the black mean, proving genetics (heredity) outweighs culture over generations.

### **4. The "Danger" of Hereditarianism**
*   **The Nazi Fear:** People fear race realism leads to genocide.
    *   *Rebuttal:* Nazis were **anti-Darwinian** pseudoscience believers ("World Ice Theory"). They rejected IQ tests as "Jewish Science."
    *   *Modern Reality:* Elites already implicitly know intelligence varies (hence "Special Ed" vs. "Gifted"). They don't murder low-IQ people; they just educate them differently.
*   **The Danger of the Status Quo:**
    *   Wokism is actively destroying art, scholarship, and social cohesion. It brainwashes white children to hate themselves.
    *   *Conclusion:* The risk of a "Hereditarian Revolution" is speculative; the damage of Wokism is actual and severe.

### **5. The Problem with the Current "Race Realist" Community**
*   **The Quality Control Issue:**
    *   Current "Race Realists" are mostly **Low-IQ JQ (Jewish Question) obsessives**.
    *   *Data:* Hereditarian whites have lower verbal IQs (Wordsum) than environmentalist whites.
    *   *Consequence:* This repels normal elites. The movement needs to disassociate from "thugs and crackpots" and attract high-caliber intellectuals.
*   **The Timidity of Scholars:**
    *   Charles Murray denied *The Bell Curve* made genetic claims when pressed by Stephen Colbert.
    *   *Cofnas’s Standard:* Leaders must be willing to "confess the murder" (like Darwin). Arguments don't win on their own; they need courageous proponents.

### **6. The Future Landscape (Post-Woke)**
*   **Not White Nationalism:**
    *   Cofnas rejects White Nationalism, citing Nietzsche. He has no desire to "quarantine" himself from non-whites.
    *   *Critique of WN:* Internet White Nationalists have produced "tens of millions of racist posts" but **zero great art or science**. They are not the guardians of Western Civilization.
*   **Not Colorblindness:**
    *   Class-based affirmative action is worse than race-based (it targets the most talented whites/Asians).
    *   Race provides information about expected outcomes. AI recognizes patterns because they exist. "Colorblindness" is a lie.
*   **The New Equilibrium:**
    *   **Rethinking Values:** We must rethink "borderless worlds" and "multiculturalism" in light of biological reality.
    *   **Policy:** Legislators must consider the *dysgenic* or *eugenic* effects of policy.
    *   **Stopgap Measures:** In the transition, we might need "guaranteed representation" (not quotas) to ensure stability, but eventually, communities may self-segregate or organize by values.
    *   **Conclusion:** Race Realism is not a utopia, but it crumbles the central pillar of the Leftist moral order. Once the Equality Thesis is gone, a new value system will inevitably emerge.
