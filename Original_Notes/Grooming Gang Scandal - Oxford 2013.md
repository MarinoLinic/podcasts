Summary:
This document comprises the sentencing remarks by Judge Peter Rook QC at the Central Criminal Court, following the conviction of seven men—Akhtar Dogar (29), Anjum Dogar (31), Kamar Jamil (27), Mohammed Karrar (38), Bassam Karrar (33), Assad Hussein (32), and Zeshan Ahmed (28)—for a series of grave sexual offenses against six vulnerable underage girls in Oxford over several years (primarily 2004–2012). The crimes involved grooming, rape, conspiracy to rape, arranging child prostitution, trafficking, and related acts, often characterized by extreme depravity, planning, and commercial exploitation. The judge emphasized the defendants' targeting of girls with troubled backgrounds, using drugs (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, heroin), alcohol, and threats to coerce compliance, while exploiting a perceived "sub-culture" in the Cowley Road area where authorities showed "willful blindness." The offenses were deemed outside standard guidelines due to their severity, with the judge applying the totality principle and finding several defendants "dangerous," justifying life sentences. Victims (anonymized as AB, CD, EF, GH, IJ, KL) displayed immense courage in testifying, despite past disbelief by police and social services. The crimes caused profound psychological harm, including PTSD, depression, self-loathing, lost education, and family torment.

#### Victim Impacts
The abuse robbed the girls of their adolescence, leading to addiction, isolation from families, and long-term trauma. For instance:
- **AB** (abused from age 13–15): Diagnosed with PTSD; suffers anxiety, depression, self-loathing; lost secondary education but later held jobs. Her parents endured "years of sheer torture," feeling powerless as she became aggressive and secretive.
- **EF** (abused from under 13): Lost half her childhood and education; now ultra-fearful, with nightmares, panic attacks, flashbacks, and depression; carries shame. Her mother searched streets nightly, faced threats, and sold their home to flee Oxford.
- **GH** (abused from age 11): Endured extreme physical and mental harm, including illegal abortion and branding; became obsessed with abusers but later resisted.
- Families overall felt isolated, guilty, and angry, compounded by systemic failures.

#### Specific Examples and Depraved Instances of Torture
The judge highlighted repeated brutality, humiliation, and commercial gain, with depravity often escalating when girls resisted. Key examples:

- **AB (Targeted by Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Kamar Jamil)**:
  - Groomed with drugs, alcohol, and threats (e.g., burning her house and brother). Coerced into sex with "vast numbers" of strangers (up to 4–5 per session) from cities like Bradford and London, sometimes photographed for promotion. Described as a "pack mentality," with men traveling far; sessions left her exhausted.
  - **Most depraved: Shotover Woods ordeal (Count 10)** – Pretended to have her period to avoid sex; Akhtar checked forcibly. At night in a remote, pitch-black car park, forced to kneel for oral sex with the three defendants amid verbal abuse ("what they do to pigs," threats to cut her throat). Another car with four men arrived (invited); forced oral sex on them as they encouraged each other. Abandoned afterward; she ironically called them for help.
  - Other tortures: Customers slapped her, pulled hair, burned her with cigarettes, scratched her vagina with nails, inserted a hairbrush into her vagina.

- **CD (Targeted by Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Kamar Jamil)**:
  - Shy, immature girl (under 16); introduced via AB, plied with alcohol before sex with strangers. Lasted ~7 weeks in 2006.
  - **Depraved instances**: Akhtar forced oral sex, becoming threatening and grabbing her (Count 14); Anjum pressured oral sex by pulling her head (Count 15), both threatening with guns. Kamar, with another man, took her to a remote lake for oral and vaginal rape, grabbing her ponytail.

- **EF (Targeted by Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar)**:
  - Groomed from under 13 with drugs; trafficked to Nanford Guest House three times for sex with strangers, once forced oral sex in a car with degrading verbal abuse.
  - **Most depraved: Bassam's Nanford assault (Count 22, age 14)** – After cocaine, refused to let her leave; prolonged rape with physical violence—jumped on her, pulled hair, forced head onto penis, vaginal penetration twice, hands around neck (throttling, couldn't breathe), threats to kill, pushed into shower and urinated on her for humiliation.
  - Mohammed trafficked her to London (Paddington) 5–6 times for sex; threatened her and mother in 2009–2010 (e.g., kill them over phone).

- **GH (Targeted by Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar; most extensive abuse, from age 11)**:
  - Introduced at 11 (small girl, parents disabled); Mohammed anally raped her early, had regular oral/vaginal/anal sex, duped her with marriage promises. At 12, impregnated; reacted by slapping her, took her to Reading for illegal abortion at an underground clinic (highly dangerous, no regard for health).
  - **Most depraved instances**:
    - **Baseball bat torture (Counts 27, age 12)**: After rape and her threat with a knife, Mohammed struck her head with a baseball bat, then inserted the silver metal handle into her vagina.
    - **Branding**: Mohammed branded her near her anal passage with a hot hair pin (his initial) as if she were property.
    - **Gang anal rape preparation (Count 30, under 13)**: Mohammed used a pump to expand her anal passage; gang-raped by 5–6 men, with four inside her at once; red ball in mouth to silence her.
    - **Spit roasting (Count 28)**: Both brothers raped her simultaneously (oral and vaginal/anal) multiple times, age unclear but young.
    - Commercial sessions: Taken to Nanford House >50 times (2–3x/week), High Wycombe (3–10 men/session, including fantasies and object insertions), Bournemouth hotel, Oxford flat. Restrained if resisting; videos made for promotion. Provided crack, injected heroin (Count 40).
    - In 2011 (age 17/18), Mohammed pulled down trousers and raped her to punish resistance.
  - Bassam organized sessions, took phone calls for Wycombe trips; both got angry if she refused, forcing depraved acts.

- **IJ and KL (Targeted by Assad Hussein, Zeshan Ahmed)**:
  - Less extreme but exploitative: IJ (14, emotionally immature) groomed by Zeshan with false identities, drugs/alcohol; vaginal sex 5–10 times. Assad had sex with her once under influence. KL (15) abused by Zeshan under alcohol influence; no violence but manipulative grooming.

#### Sentences
- **Akhtar & Anjum Dogar**: Life imprisonment (min. 17 years each, equiv. 34-year determinate) for conspiracies to rape (Counts 3,12,16); concurrent terms up to 20 years. Deemed dangerous due to risk to young girls.
- **Kamar Jamil**: Life (min. 12 years, equiv. 24-year) for conspiracies; concurrent up to 16 years. Lesser role but still depraved.
- **Mohammed Karrar**: Life (min. 20 years, equiv. 40-year) for multiple counts; concurrent up to 20 years. Exceptional depravity noted.
- **Bassam Karrar**: Life (min. 15 years, equiv. 30-year); concurrent up to 20 years. Dangerous, with brutal elements.
- **Assad Hussein**: 7 years total (5 for AB, 2 consecutive for IJ); indefinite SOPO (Sexual Offences Prevention Order).
- **Zeshan Ahmed**: 7 years total (5 for IJ, 2 consecutive for KL); indefinite SOPO.
All face indefinite notification requirements and barring from working with children. The judge hoped the case deters others and prompts better authority responses.
