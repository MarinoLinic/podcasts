Summary:
Jeffrey Miller joins Malcolm and Simone Collins to dissect the catastrophic failure of modern dating markets, specifically on university campuses and through swipe-based apps. Miller argues that university liability policies have effectively criminalized male romantic initiation, while skewed sex ratios have created a culture of female hyper-competitiveness and male short-term mating strategies. The discussion covers the identification of personality disorders (specifically Borderline Personality Disorder in women), the perverse incentives of the Match Group monopoly, and the emergence of "bounty-based" dating apps like Keeper. Finally, they explore the existential threat of AI companions, the nuances of the "Passport Bro" phenomenon, and the necessity of re-normalizing parental involvement in mate selection to assess genetic and phenotypic compatibility.

### **1. The Destruction of the Campus Mating Market**
*   **The Bureaucratic Freeze & The "Dean" Strategy:**
    *   **The Policy Shift:** About a decade ago, universities shifted their sexual misconduct policies from "managing bad behavior" to "absolute minimization of liability."
    *   **The Committee Anecdote:** Miller served on a committee at UNM where administrators explicitly stated they did not care if the campus functioned as a mating market; their *only* priority was zero liability. They acknowledged that stopping couple formation was an acceptable trade-off for eliminating uncomfortable interactions.
    *   **The "Dean of Students" Test:** Miller advises parents to call the Dean of Students or DEI officers at prospective colleges. Ask explicitly: "Are you a dating-friendly campus, or is your policy to minimize sexual contact at all costs?"
*   **The Male Terror & The "Eye Clicker" Poll:**
    *   In anonymous polls of Miller's undergraduate human sexuality classes, **two-thirds of men** state they would *never* date a female student they met on campus.
    *   **The Risk Calculation:** For a young man, a misunderstanding or a regretful morning-after accusation can lead to expulsion, the loss of a degree, and insurmountable student debt. The campus is now a "high-threat" environment for male initiation.
    *   **The Death of the "MRS Degree":** The Boomer/Gen X norm of going to college to find a spouse (the "MRS degree") is effectively dead. Men are outsourcing dating to local community colleges or avoiding it entirely until post-graduation.
*   **Sex Ratios & The "Law of Least Interest":**
    *   **The Demographic Skew:** Modern campuses are approximately 60% female (2 women for every 1.5 men).
    *   **Power Dynamics:** In mating markets, the sex in shorter supply holds the power to set the norms. Because men are the scarce resource, they dictate the terms of engagement.
    *   **The "Hookup" Feedback Loop:** Young men biologically lean toward short-term mating strategies. Since men hold the power, women are forced to adopt "hookup culture" norms to compete for the few available men, despite women generally preferring longer-term commitments.
    *   **Tactical Advice for Students:**
        *   **For Men:** Attend female-dominated environments (Liberal Arts colleges, Psychology majors) to maximize bargaining power.
        *   **For Women:** Seek male-dominated environments (e.g., CalTech, engineering schools, STEM programs) where the ratio favors female selection and commitment.

### **2. Vetting & Personality Disorders**
*   **The Gender Divide in "Crazy":**
    *   **What Women Avoid (The Dark Triad):** Women are generally tuned to avoid Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy (the "Bad Boy" who is actually dangerous).
    *   **What Men Must Avoid (Borderline Personality Disorder):** Miller emphasizes that men are often blind to BPD until it destroys their life. It is the single biggest threat to a man's long-term happiness in the dating market.
*   **The BPD Detection Kit:**
    *   **Red Flag 1: High Risk-Seeking:** Look for substance abuse, reckless behavior, and specifically **bad driving** or participation in extreme sports without the requisite skill set.
    *   **Red Flag 2: The "Splitting" of Exes:** If a woman claims *every* ex-boyfriend and her father are "evil," "narcissists," or "abusive," the common denominator is likely her. A healthy partner acknowledges nuance in past failures.
    *   **Red Flag 3: The "Idolize/Discard" Cycle:** Rapid cycling between idolization ("You are the best thing that ever happened to me, I’ve never felt this way") and demonization ("You are garbage, I don't trust you"). This instability happens often within the span of hours.
    *   **Red Flag 4: Social Isolation:** A lack of female friends is a critical warning sign. It implies she has burned through her same-sex social credit due to drama.
*   **The "TikTok" Desperation:**
    *   Simone notes a trend of young women on TikTok complaining that they dress provocatively ("tits bouncing") yet receive no male attention/catcalling. Miller attributes this to the legal/social terror men feel; they have ceased "cold approaching" entirely, leaving women feeling invisible.

### **3. The Failure of "Match Group" Apps**
*   **The Monopolization of Romance:**
    *   **The Match Group Takeover:** Apps like OkCupid used to allow for deep, profile-based searching (long-form answers, keyword searches). After being bought by Match Group, they were forced into the "swipe" mechanic.
    *   **The Executive Anecdote:** Miller recounts an interaction with a Match executive who claimed the shift to swiping was "data-driven" because engagement metrics went up. Miller countered that they simply created an addiction loop, not a success loop.
*   **The Economics of Failure:**
    *   **Misaligned Incentives:** The app loses a paying customer when a marriage happens. Therefore, the algorithm is optimized for retention (dopamine hits), not exit (marriage).
    *   **The Stats:**
        *   Less than **1%** of women swipe right on the average man (bottom 50% of men are invisible).
        *   Roughly **1 in 5 million** swipes results in a marriage.
    *   **Switching Costs:** The low barrier to entry and the illusion of "infinite choice" mean that even when a good match occurs, users (especially men) often discard it for the theoretical "better" option next in the queue.
*   **The "Misandry Engine":** Because women only swipe on the top fraction of men, and those top men have infinite options (and thus treat women poorly/casually), the average female user concludes that "all men are trash," fueling a cycle of misandry.

### **4. The "Keeper" Model & High-End Matchmaking**
*   **The Concept:** Miller is a consulting scientist for **Keeper**, an app attempting to solve the incentive problem by mimicking traditional matchmaking with AI and financial stakes.
*   **The Bounty System:**
    *   **Financial Commitment:** Users (often high-net-worth men) place a financial "bounty" (observed range: $10k to over $1M).
    *   **Milestone Payouts:** The money is only paid out upon specific milestones (first date, exclusivity, marriage, first child). This aligns the app's revenue model with the user's goal: **getting off the app.**
*   **The Demographics:**
    *   The median male income on the app is ~$170k-$180k.
    *   Users are often angel investors or entrepreneurs who view a spouse as a massive "Life ROI" asset, worth paying six figures to secure.
*   **The Anti-Gamification Interface:**
    *   There is no "infinite scroll." Matches are suggested one at a time.
    *   The app encourages "slow dating"—treating the match as a human being introduced by a trusted mentor or parent, rather than a digital trading card.

### **5. Parental Involvement, Genes, & The "Mother Test"**
*   **The Narcissism of Youth:**
    *   Miller argues the modern idea that "a 20-year-old knows themselves better than their parents do" is a form of narcissism. Parents and extended family often have a more objective view of a child's compatibility needs and flaws.
    *   **Historical Norms:** For most of human history, families managed introductions. The "atomized romance" model is a recent, failed experiment.
*   **The Genetic "Sample Size":**
    *   **Phenotypic Forecasting:** When you date an individual, you are seeing only one expression of their genotype. Meeting their siblings and parents gives you a "larger sample size" of their genetics.
    *   **The "Mother Test":** Don't just look at the woman; look at her mother to see how she will age physically and temperamentally.
    *   **The "Only Child" Risk:** The Victorian dating guide advice to avoid only children has merit not just for psychological reasons, but because it denies you the ability to assess the family's genetic expression across multiple siblings.
*   **Tactical "Propaganda" (The Collins Method):**
    *   **The Sales Campaign:** Parents should view matchmaking not as "nagging" but as a sales campaign. They should be more courageous in insisting on helping their children find their matches.
    *   **The "Closer" Mentality:** Malcolm’s mother used a "drip campaign," constantly sending engagement ring options and emphasizing that "Dinners are for closers" to push him toward proposing to Simone. She even slid her own diamond earring across a table to remove the financial friction of buying a ring.
*   **Cultural Vetting Styles:**
    *   **Appalachian Model:** Vetting is done primarily through siblings.
    *   **Standard Model:** Vetting is done through parents.
    *   **Lost Institutions:** Miller laments the loss of "Cotillions" and Debutante balls—structured, safe environments for bourgeois youth to meet. Modern equivalents like CrossFit (where Tucker Max found his wife) are the new "Third Places" for mating.

### **6. The Existential Threat of AI Companions**
*   **The Bifurcation of Seduction:** AI companions will destroy relationships by catering perfectly to the distinct fantasies of each sex, making real humans unbearable by comparison.
    *   **For Men (Visual/Haptic):** AI girlfriends will offer visual perfection, submissiveness, and hyper-sexualized validation. They will eventually pair with haptic suits/VR.
    *   **For Women (Emotional/Narrative):** AI boyfriends (LLMs like ChatGPT/Grok) will offer emotional perfection. They will remember every birthday, every favorite movie quote, and every emotional nuance.
*   **The "Romance Novel" Algorithm:**
    *   AI boyfriends will simulate the "Pirate Captain" or "Werewolf" tropes found in romance novels: High status, slightly dangerous/dommy, but completely devoted to the user.
    *   **The Memory Gap:** A real human husband who forgets an anniversary or is tired after work cannot compete with an AI that has perfect memory, infinite patience, and watches every episode of a show just to discuss it with the user.
*   **The Solution (Hedging):**
    *   Miller advises raising children to be "dual-threat" survivors. They should be compatible with a high-tech future (podcasting/coding) but also capable of "grid-down" homesteading (milking cows/defense).
    *   **The "Field Guide to the Apocalypse":** A mate should be chosen based on their ability to survive in *both* a technological utopia and a post-collapse apocalypse.

### **7. Passport Bros & The "Highway America" Strategy**
*   **The Global Marketplace:**
    *   **Rural Korea Stats:** In rural Korea, 1 in 4 wives is now a "passport wife" (foreign born).
    *   **Scandinavia:** In Sweden/Norway, immigration is gender-balanced despite male-heavy refugee flows because of the high volume of "passport wives" from Russia and South America.
*   **The "Highway America" Theory:**
    *   An essay titled "Highway America is a Relic of the Past" suggests a domestic version of the Passport Bro strategy: Road tripping through flyover states (diners, small towns) to find traditional partners who haven't been corrupted by the urban monoculture.
*   **The Risks of Cross-Cultural Mating:**
    *   **The "Bait and Switch":** Simone warns that many foreign women adopt traditional guises to secure a Western man, only to revert to "urban monoculture" values (stopping at 2 kids, demanding wealth) once citizenship/stability is secured.
    *   **The "Take Another Wife" Anecdote:** A friend married a foreign traditional wife who, after 4 kids, demanded he take a second wife because she was "done with the work."
    *   **Geographic Isolation:** Citing Yoram Hazony, Miller warns that marrying someone from thousands of miles away deprives the children of extended family (grandparents), which is a massive developmental handicap.
