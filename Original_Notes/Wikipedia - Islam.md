### **1. Etymology, Definition, and Articles of Faith**
*   **Etymological Roots:**
    *   **Root:** Derived from the trilateral root *S-L-M* (concepts of submission, safeness, peace).
    *   **Grammar:** *Islam* is the verbal noun (Form IV) meaning "total surrender to the will of God." *Muslim* is the active participle, meaning "submitter."
    *   **Alternative Interpretation:** Scholar Mohsen Goudarzi argues that in the Quran, *dīn* meant "worship," *islām* meant "monotheism," and *muslim* meant "monotheist."
    *   **Exonyms:** Historically called "Mohammedanism" in the West; now considered offensive as it implies worship of Muhammad rather than God.
*   **Tawhid (Absolute Monotheism):**
    *   God (*Allah*) is incomparable, unique, and has no partners. Associating partners with God is *shirk* (idolatry), the highest sin.
    *   **Attributes:** God is described by names, most commonly *Ar-Rahmān* (The Entirely Merciful) and *Ar-Rahīm* (The Especially Merciful).
    *   **Nature:** God is a "personal god" with no intermediaries (clergy) but is beyond gender or plurality. The creation is brought into being by the command "Be, and it is."
*   **Angels (*Mala'ikah*):**
    *   Created from light (*nūr*) or fire (*nār*), they lack bodily desires (eating/drinking).
    *   **Functions:** Communicating revelation (Gabriel/Jibrīl), recording deeds, taking souls at death.
*   **Scriptures (*Kutub*):**
    *   Belief in previous revelations: *Tawrat* (Torah/Moses), *Zabur* (Psalms/David), *Injil* (Gospel/Jesus).
    *   **Status:** Muslims believe previous scriptures were distorted or altered over time. The **Quran** is the final, verbatim, unaltered word of God, divided into 114 *surahs* (chapters) and 6,236 *ayat* (verses).
*   **Prophets (*Anbiya*):**
    *   Human, not divine. Chosen to preach the same message: submission to God.
    *   **Lineage:** Includes Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus.
    *   **Muhammad:** The "Seal of the Prophets," sent to convey the completed message. His life example (*Sunnah*) is preserved in *Hadith* (reports), composed of a *sanad* (chain of narrators) and *matn* (text).
*   **Resurrection (*Qiyamah*) and Judgment:**
    *   **The Day:** Preordained but unknown timing. Involves bodily resurrection.
    *   **The Weight:** "Atom's weight" of good or evil will be judged.
    *   **Outcome:** *Jannah* (Paradise) is a place of physical and spiritual joy; *Jahannam* (Hell) is for the unrighteous. Forgiveness is available for those who repent.
*   **Predestination (*Qadar*):**
    *   Everything, good or bad, is decreed by God. The term implies "measuring" or "calculating."
    *   **Cultural Manifestation:** The phrase *In-sha-Allah* ("If God Wills") is ubiquitous regarding future events.

### **2. The Five Pillars and Acts of Worship**
*   **Shahada (The Creed):** "I testify that there is no deity except God and I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God." Required recitation for conversion.
*   **Salah (Prayer):**
    *   **Structure:** Five daily timed prayers facing the Kaaba (Mecca). Consists of repeating units (*rakat*) involving bowing and prostration.
    *   **Purity:** Requires *wudu* (ritual washing) or *ghusl* (full body wash).
    *   **Community:** Friday noon prayer (*Jumu'ah*) is congregational. Mosques (*Masjid*) feature *minarets* for the call to prayer (*adhan*).
*   **Zakat (Almsgiving):**
    *   **Fixed Rate:** Typically 2.5% of accumulated wealth annually.
    *   **Function:** A religious obligation to "purify" excess wealth. It funds the poor, debt relief, travelers, and freeing captives.
    *   **Scale:** Estimated annual global Zakat is 15 times greater than global humanitarian aid.
    *   **Institutions:** *Sadaqah* is optional charity; *Waqf* is a perpetual charitable trust (funding schools/hospitals).
*   **Sawm (Fasting):**
    *   **Ramadan:** Abstaining from food, drink, and smoking from dawn to sunset.
    *   **Purpose:** To develop *Taqwa* (God-consciousness), self-restraint, and empathy for the needy.
*   **Hajj (Pilgrimage):**
    *   **Requirement:** Once a lifetime during the month *Dhu al-Hijjah*.
    *   **Rituals:** Walking seven times around the Kaaba, running between Safa and Marwa (reenacting Hagar's search for water), standing at Mount Arafat, and stoning the Devil.
    *   **Equality:** Men wear *Ihram* (two unstitched white cloths) to strip away class distinctions.
*   **Other Acts:**
    *   **Recitation:** *Tajwid* (rules of elocution). A *Hafiz* is one who memorizes the entire Quran.

### **3. History: Origins and the Early State**
*   **The Prophet (570–632 CE):**
    *   Born in Mecca, orphaned early, worked as a trader ("The Trusted One"). Married employer **Khadija**.
    *   **Revelation:** At age 40 (610 CE), received first revelation in the **Cave of Hira** on the "Night of Power."
    *   **Conflict:** Preached monotheism, threatening the Meccan elite's trade at the idolatrous Kaaba. Early converts were women, slaves (e.g., Bilal), and the poor.
*   **The Turning Point (Hijra):**
    *   **622 CE:** Emigration to Yathrib (**Medina**). Marks the start of the Islamic calendar.
    *   **State Building:** The **Constitution of Medina** established a multi-tribal polity with religious freedom and mutual defense, uniting the *Ansar* (Medinan converts) and *Muhajirun* (Meccan migrants).
*   **War and Peace:**
    *   **Battles:** *Badr* (Muslim victory), *Uhud* (inconclusive/setback), *The Trench* (failed Meccan siege).
    *   **Diplomacy:** Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628) allowed a pause; broken by Mecca later.
    *   **Conquest:** Mecca fell in 629 in a largely bloodless conquest. By 632, Arabia was united.

### **4. The Caliphate, Civil Wars, and Schisms**
*   **Rashidun Caliphate ("Rightly Guided"):**
    *   **Abu Bakr:** Crushed rebellions in the **Ridda Wars**. Began Quran compilation.
    *   **Umar:** Massive expansion into Persia/Byzantium. Established the *Bayt al-mal* (treasury) and welfare stipends.

    *   **Ali:** Cousin/Son-in-law of Muhammad. His reign was defined by civil strife (*Fitna*).
*   **The Fitna (Civil War):**
    *   **Battle of the Camel:** Ali vs. Aisha (Muhammad’s widow) over Uthman's death.
    *   **Battle of Siffin:** Ali vs. Mu'awiya (Governor of Syria). Ended in arbitration.
    *   **The Kharijites:** Extremist sect that rejected the arbitration, believing "judgment belongs only to God." They assassinated Ali.
*   **The Sunni/Shia Split:**
    *   **Politics:** Sunni believed in elected succession (Abu Bakr); Shia believed it belonged to the family (*Ahl al-Bayt*), specifically Ali.
    *   **Karbala:** Husayn (Ali's son) was killed by Yazid I (Umayyad). This event solidified the Shia identity of martyrdom and resistance.
*   **Umayyad Dynasty (Damascus):**
    *   Expanded to Spain (Iberia) and Sindh (India).
    *   **Issues:** Relied on Arab supremacy. Non-Arab converts (*Mawali*) were often denied status to keep *Jizya* (tax on non-Muslims) revenue flowing.

    *   **Philosophy:** Al-Farabi and Averroes tried to harmonize Aristotle with Islam. Al-Ghazali argued against syncretism (Incoherence of the Philosophers).
