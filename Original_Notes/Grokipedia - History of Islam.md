Summary:
The article presents a historical survey of Islam, commencing with the prophetic mission of Muhammad (610 CE) and the distinct socio-economic landscape of pre-Islamic Arabia. It traces the rapid militaristic expansion under the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, which dismantled the Sassanid Empire and crippled Byzantium. The text critically analyzes historiography, contrasting the "Standard Islamic Narrative" (Sira/Hadith) with Revisionist scholarship (Hagarism, archaeological gaps). It details the intellectual zenith of the Golden Age, the sectarian ossification of the Sunni/Shia schism, and the devastation of the Mongol invasions. The notes cover the rise of the Gunpowder Empires (Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal), the erosion of sovereignty via European capitulations and colonialism, and the turbulent 20th century (Caliphate abolition, Arab-Israeli wars, Global Jihadism). Finally, it offers a deep dive into doctrinal controversies, including offensive Jihad, the institutionalization of slavery, gender jurisprudence, and the textual transmission of the Quran.

### **1. Historiography, Source Criticism & Revisionism**
*   **The Problem of Sources:**
    *   **Late Compilation:** The primary Islamic sources (Sira, Hadith, Tafsir) were compiled **150–250 years** after Muhammad's death. There are no contemporary Muslim autographs from the 7th century.
    *   **The Hadith Corpus:**
        *   **Scale:** **Sahih al-Bukhari** (d. 870 CE) sifted through ~600,000 narrations to select roughly 7,000 (approx. 2,600 without repetition) as *Sahih* (authentic).
        *   **Fabrication (*Wada'*):** Widespread forgery occurred to support political factions (Umayyad vs. Abbasid), legal schools, or sectarian theology. Even classical scholars like **al-Nawawi** admitted some "authentic" narrations contained anomalies (*Shadh*).
        *   **Isnad Criticism:** The methodology focused on the reputation of the transmitter rather than the plausibility of the content (*Matn*). Common links often converge on 8th-century figures, suggesting later projection.
    *   **The Sira (Biography):**
        *   **Ibn Ishaq (c. 767 CE):** The foundational biographer. His work is lost and survives only in the recension of **Ibn Hisham** (d. 833 CE).
        *   **Sanitization:** Ibn Hisham admitted to removing "reprehensible" passages from Ibn Ishaq’s original work (e.g., details offending the Abbasids or the Satanic Verses incident).
*   **Non-Muslim Contemporary Witnesses (7th Century):**
    *   **Doctrina Jacobi (July 634 CE):** A Greek anti-Jewish tract from Carthage. Mentions a "prophet" among the "Saracens" who proclaims the advent of the Anointed One (Messiah) and wields the sword.
    *   **Thomas the Presbyter (640 CE):** Syriac chronicle recording a battle between the "Arabs of Muhammad" and Romans near Gaza in 634.
    *   **Sebeos (Armenian Bishop, c. 660 CE):** Describes "Mahmet" as a merchant preaching Abrahamic monotheism to unite Arab tribes for the conquest of the Promised Land.
    *   *Significance:* These confirm the historical existence of Muhammad and the military nature of the movement but lack the specific theological details (e.g., the Quran) found in later traditions.
*   **Modern Revisionist Scholarship:**
    *   **Hagarism (Crone & Cook, 1977):** Proposed that early Islam was a "Hagarene" messianic coalition of Arabs and Jews aiming to retake Jerusalem. The split from Judaism occurred later.
    *   **The "Meccan Trade" Thesis:** Patricia Crone (1987) argued Mecca was **not** a major trade hub on the incense route (which had shifted maritime), challenging the economic explanation for the Quraysh's power.
    *   **Archaeological Silence:**
        *   No "Islamic" coins mentioning Muhammad or the Shahada appear until the 680s/690s (under Abd al-Malik). Early conquests used modified Byzantine/Sassanid coinage with crosses merely obscured.
        *   No mosques with explicitly Mecca-facing *Qiblas* are conclusively dated to the earliest period (some argue early Qiblas faced Petra or Jerusalem).

### **2. Pre-Islamic Arabia (Jahiliyyah)**
*   **Religious Geography:**
    *   **Polytheism:** Centered on the **Kaaba** in Mecca (360 idols). Key deities: **Hubal** (chief idol, red agate), and the "Daughters of Allah" (**Al-Lat**, **Al-Uzza**, **Manat**). Rituals included animal sacrifice and circumambulation.
    *   **Judaism:** Dominant in Yemen (Himyarite Kingdom under **Dhu Nuwas**) and Medina (tribes: **Banu Qurayza**, **Banu Nadir**, **Banu Qaynuqa**).
    *   **Christianity:**
        *   **Najran:** Center of Christianity in the south; suffered a massacre by Jewish Himyarites in **523 CE**.
        *   **Ghassanids:** Monophysite Christian Arab tribal confederation allied with Byzantium.
        *   **Lakhmids:** Nestorian Christian Arabs allied with the Sassanids (capital: Al-Hira).
    *   **Hanifs:** Pre-Islamic monotheists (e.g., Zayd ibn Amr) who rejected idolatry but were not Christian/Jewish.
*   **Socio-Economic Structure:**
    *   **Tribalism:** Society organized by clan (*Bani*) and tribe (*Qabila*). Justice enforced via blood feuds (*Tha'r*).
    *   **Economy:**
        *   Nomadic pastoralism (camels/sheep) in the interior.
        *   Oasis agriculture (dates/grains) in Yathrib/Ta'if.
        *   **Trade:** Quraysh controlled the caravan routes transporting frankincense, spices, and leather to Syria.

### **10. Enduring Doctrinal Controversies**
*   **Jihad:**

    *   **Scripture:** Verse 9:29 ("Fight those who do not believe... until they pay the Jizya").
*   **Slavery:**
    *   **Scripture:** Quran permits sex with "what your right hands possess" (concubines).
    *   **Arab Slave Trade:** Lasted 13 centuries. 11–17 million Africans enslaved. Systematic castration of males (eunuchs) led to high mortality.
    *   **Abolition:** Saudi Arabia (1962), Mauritania (1981).

    *   **Child Marriage:** Validated by Muhammad’s marriage to **Aisha** (betrothed 6, consummated 9). Still legal/practiced in Yemen, Iran, etc.
    *   **FGM:** Not in Quran, but supported as *Sunnah* (honorable) in Shafi'i/Hanbali schools. 99% prevalence in Somalia, 87% in Egypt.
*   **Textual Integrity:**
    *   **Sana'a Palimpsest:** Discovered in Yemen. Radiocarbon dated to <671 CE. Shows a **lower text** (erased) with different Surah ordering and words, overwritten by the standard Uthmanic text, suggesting the Quran was fluid before standardization.
