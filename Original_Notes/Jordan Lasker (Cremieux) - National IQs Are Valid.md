Summary:
The article defends the validity of National IQ estimates (specifically those compiled by Lynn and Vanhanen) against a raft of common criticisms. Cremieux argues that low national IQs (e.g., ~70) do not imply mass "mental retardation" when understood through the lens of adaptive functioning and continuous vs. discontinuous biological causes. The text demonstrates that these estimates are highly predictive of (and predicted by) national development metrics like GDP, are robust when cross-referenced with World Bank Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLOs), and are not the result of systematic racial bias or fraudulent imputation. The author contends that criticisms often rely on "vibes," the "weaponization of ignorance," and a fundamental misunderstanding of how psychometric norms and sampling frames operate in the developing world.

### **1. The "Mental Retardation" Fallacy (The Mean of 70)**
*   **The Criticism:** Critics argue that Lynn and Vanhanen’s estimates (specifically Sub-Saharan Africa having a mean IQ of ~70) are prima facie invalid because an IQ of 70 indicates "Mental Retardation" (Intellectual Disability). They argue that if a whole nation were clinically retarded, society would collapse, and people wouldn't be able to tie their shoes; therefore, the data must be wrong.
*   **The DSM-5 Rebuttal:**
    *   **Diagnostic Criteria:** The DSM-5 does **not** define Intellectual Disability (ID) solely by an IQ threshold. Diagnosis requires three simultaneous criteria:
        1.  **Intellectual Deficits:** Problems in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking, and learning from experience (confirmed by standardized testing).
        2.  **Adaptive Deficits:** Failure to meet sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. This is the crucial differentiator.
        3.  **Developmental Onset:** Deficits must appear during childhood.
    *   **Adaptive Functioning is Key:** Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Profound) is defined by adaptive functioning, **not IQ scores**. An individual can score 70 but possess the adaptive skills to function independently in their specific environment (e.g., a hunter-gatherer, a subsistence farmer, or a manual laborer), thus avoiding the diagnosis of "retarded."
*   **Continuous vs. Discontinuous Causes (The "Wrench" Analogy):**
    *   **Normal Range (Continuous):** Most IQ variation is polygenic and follows a normal distribution (Bell Curve). A score of 70 can simply represent the lower end of a normal distribution due to normal genetic/environmental variation. In this range, adaptive behavior scales linearly with IQ.
    *   **Pathological (Discontinuous):** Extremely low IQs are often caused by specific traumas, de novo mutations, or "wrenches in the gears" (e.g., Down Syndrome, brain injury).
    *   **The "Machine" Analogy:** It is easy to break a machine (trauma/mutation) to make it work poorly (pathology). It is impossible to hit a machine with a wrench and turn it into a supercomputer (genius). Pathological low IQ is different from natural low IQ.
    *   **The "Troglodyte" Myth:** If a population has a mean IQ of 70 due to normal-range causes, they will not be "drooling troglodytes." They will simply be less efficient at abstract reasoning tasks, but fully capable of basic self-care and social interaction.
*   **The Sibling Test (Reichenberg et al. 2015):**
    *   *Mild Disability (Normal Range/Continuous):* When a person has mild ID, their siblings tend to have lower-than-average intelligence. This indicates a **shared genetic/environmental cause** (polygenic traits like height or autism work the same way).
    *   *Severe/Idiopathic Disability (Pathological/Discontinuous):* When a person has severe ID (e.g., a specific mutation), their siblings’ IQ distribution matches the **general population mean**. The cause is a "one-off" error (idiopathic) that is not shared by the family.
*   **Jensen’s Observation (1972):**
    *   Arthur Jensen noted a massive qualitative difference between "Educationally Mentally Retarded" (EMR) children of different backgrounds.
    *   **Minority/Low-SES EMR:** Children with IQs <75 often appeared socially competent ("brighter socially"), played normally on the playground, and were indistinguishable from normal children outside the classroom.
    *   **White Middle-Class EMR:** Children with the same IQs (<75) from high-SES backgrounds generally appeared genuinely pathologically retarded "all around," not just in school.
    *   *Conclusion:* An IQ of 70 in a high-mean group (e.g., White Middle Class) likely signals a severe biological error. An IQ of 70 in a low-mean group signals a normal variant who is functionally competent.

### **2. Validation via Economic Development (GDP & HLOs)**
*   **The "Hard-Line Hereditarian" Argument:**
    *   Some critics (and researchers like Wicherts et al.) argue that Sub-Saharan African IQs are actually 80–88.
    *   **The Logical Trap:** Richard Lynn noted that 85–88 is the mean IQ of African Americans. If Africans in impoverished Nigeria had the same IQ as African Americans living in the US (with its superior nutrition, healthcare, and education), it would imply that environmental disadvantages have **zero effect** on cognitive development. Even the most ardent hereditarians generally admit environment plays some role; claiming African IQs are 88 implies the environment implies nothing.
*   **Predictive Validity:** Low national IQs are mathematically predictable based on a country's development level.
    *   *Regression Analysis:* Using Log GDP PPP per capita predicts a Sub-Saharan African (SSA) mean IQ of **74.86**. The measured IQ in Lynn’s dataset is **71.96**. The difference is negligible.
    *   *HLO Data:* Using World Bank Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLOs)—a completely separate dataset published in *Nature* (2021) by Angrist et al.—the observed SSA mean is **71.05**.
    *   *Piecewise Regression:* Because the relationship between wealth and IQ is non-linear (diminishing returns), splitting the regression at $50k GDP yields a predicted SSA IQ of **76.12**.
    *   *Actual Individual Consumption (AIC):* Models using AIC instead of GDP (which smooths out distortions from tax havens and oil-rich kleptocracies) show an even tighter fit between predicted and measured IQs.
*   **Conclusion:** The estimates are consistent with economic reality. Low scores are not errors; they are exactly where they should be given the developmental status of the region.

### **3. The Imputation Defense**
*   **The Charge:** Critics claim Lynn "faked" data by imputing scores for countries where tests didn't exist, effectively inventing numbers to fill the map.
*   **The Method:** Lynn used **Spatial Autocorrelation**. If a country was missing data, he used the average of its three neighbors (weighted by border length). For island nations, he used the three closest countries.
    *   *Scientific Validity:* This is standard practice when data is "missing not-at-random" (MNAR). Spatial autocorrelation is a known phenomenon in geography and econometrics.
    *   *US State Analogy:* Cremieux demonstrates this works within the US. Predicting the Black-White achievement gap for a state based solely on its neighbors (e.g., predicting Michigan via Minnesota, or NY via RI) yields a correlation of **0.60** with the real data.
*   **Validation of Imputation:**
    *   Lynn’s 2002 imputed estimates correlate at **r = 0.90** with the "current best" real data collected years later.
    *   *Bias Check:* Far from lowering scores to fit a racist narrative, Lynn’s imputations tended to **overestimate** the scores of poor nations.
        *   **2002 Imputations:** Overestimated subsequent real data by an average of **1.47 points**.
        *   **2012 Imputations:** Overestimated subsequent real data by an average of **0.72 points**.
    *   *Conclusion:* Imputation added power to the dataset without introducing systematic negative bias.

### **4. Debunking "Systematic Racial Bias"**
*   **The Charge:** Lynn systematically downgraded non-white nations due to personal or ideological bias.
*   **The Cross-Check:** Cremieux compares Lynn’s estimates to completely independent datasets (Current Best National IQs and World Bank HLOs).
*   **The Data:**
    *   **Europe:** Lynn *underestimated* Europe by ~0.61 to 1.01 points compared to modern best estimates.
    *   **Latin America:** Lynn *overestimated* the region by **4.21 points** (original estimates) and **2.74 points** (HLO comparison).
    *   **South Asia:** Lynn *overestimated* the region by **5.89 points**.
    *   **Oceania:** Lynn *overestimated* the region by **5.71 points**.
    *   **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Lynn did underestimate SSA, but by a relatively small margin (~1.89 to 5 points depending on the benchmark).
*   **Consistency:** Whether one looks at Lynn's original dataset or the 2012 update, the pattern holds: he slightly underestimated Europe and Africa, but significantly **overestimated** Latin America and South Asia. This contradicts the theory of a systematic "Pro-White/Anti-Non-White" manipulation.

### **5. The "Poor Sample" Paradox (Elite Over-Sampling)**
*   **The Charge:** Samples from poor countries are unreliable because the subjects are underprivileged, uneducated, or sick, and Lynn deliberately chose these poor samples to make the countries look bad.
*   **The Counter-Intuitive Reality:** Samples from poor countries often **overestimate** national IQ because researchers can only access the "Elite."
    *   *Schooling Bias:* In many developing nations, a significant portion of the population (sometimes >50%) is not in school. Testing school children captures the cognitive upper-crust, ignoring the lower-IQ individuals who dropped out or never attended.
*   **Case Study: Kenya (1997) & Ghana (2015):**
    *   Critics (e.g., Russell Warne) cited samples from Kenya and Ghana to argue for higher IQs, claiming Lynn ignored these "good" samples.
    *   *Kenya Sample:* 8th graders in Nairobi (the 2nd richest county). In 1997, the average Kenyan adult had only 4.7 years of schooling. This sample was **1-2 Standard Deviations (SD)** above the national mean in SES.
    *   *Ghana Sample:* High school/University students in Accra. **61%** of the sample had 16+ years of education, while the average Ghanaian adult had only 7.8 years. This sample was **3-4 SDs** above the mean (equivalent to comparing American PhDs to American high school dropouts).
    *   *Result:* Even these hyper-selected elite samples only scored **79.08** (Kenya) and **92.32** (Ghana) on US norms.
*   **The "WDCM" Critique:**
    *   Wicherts, Dolan, Carlson & van der Maas (WDCM) argued African IQ is ~78.
    *   *Lynn's Rebuttal:* Lynn pointed out that WDCM included samples that were explicitly unrepresentative.
        *   *Notcutt (1950):* Cited a South African sample, but only ~25% of children were in school at the time.
        *   *Silvey (1970):* Cited a Ugandan sample, but admission to secondary school was based on a competitive exam where only **2%** of children were admitted. Using the top 2% of the population to estimate the national mean is statistical malpractice.
    *   *Comparability:* Critics understand this bias when China samples only from Shanghai for PISA tests (inflating scores), but refuse to apply the same logic to elite samples from Africa.

### **6. Causality & Stability**
*   **Reverse Causality Argument:** "GDP causes IQ, not vice versa."
*   **Refutation via Instruments:**
    *   Researchers use Instrumental Variables to determine causality. Factors that *cannot* be caused by modern development—such as **brain size**, **19th-century numeracy** (age-heaping), and **ancestry-adjusted UV radiation**—successfully predict modern national IQ.
    *   This suggests the arrow of causality runs dominantly from IQ -> Development.
*   **Stability over Time (The HLO Graph):**
    *   World Bank HLO data includes a revealing diagram comparing Primary Education Enrollment vs. Learning Outcomes over time.
    *   *The Trend:* While enrollment in the developing world has skyrocketed (from <20% to >80% in some cases), **learning outcomes (IQ proxies) have remained flat**.
    *   *Implication:* More kids are in school, but the average cognitive ability has not spiked. This challenges the "Flynn Effect" hope that exposure to education would rapidly close the gap.
*   **The Irony:** Lynn actually *believed* national IQs would rise with development (he was an environmentalist regarding the impact of nutrition/health). The fact that scores have remained stable despite massive development aid ironically supports a more hereditarian view than even Lynn held.

### **7. Common Critic Tactics ("The Weaponization of Ignorance")**
*   **"Vibes-based" Skepticism:** Critics reject data because it "feels wrong" or is "offensive," rather than identifying calculation errors.
*   **Anecdotes vs. Data:**
    *   *Mensa India:* Critics cite news reports of "genius kids" found in Indian slums. However, these reports never specify norms. A score of 140 on a local norm might be average globally. Without the technical manual, such anecdotes are statistically meaningless.
*   **The "Iran" Example:**
    *   A meta-analysis claimed Iran has a National IQ of 97 (same as the US).
    *   *The Flaw:* The studies used **Iranian norms**, not international norms. By definition, a test normed on a population will yield a mean of 100 *for that population*. It says nothing about how that mean compares to the US or UK.
*   **The "Haiti" Cherry-Pick:**
    *   Critics argue Haiti's IQ rose from 60 to 100 based on two data points: one from the 1940s and one from the 1970s. This relies on ignoring all other data and assuming a single later study is "ground truth" simply because it is later (and the result is more socially desirable).
*   **Psychometric Bias:**
    *   Critics claim tests are culturally biased against non-whites.
    *   *Counter-Evidence:* When bias is checked (e.g., measurement invariance), it often runs the other way. In comparisons between Britons and South Africans, the psychometric bias actually **favored the lower-scoring South African group**.
*   **The Flynn Effect:**
    *   Critics wave the "Flynn Effect" as a magic wand to dismiss differences.
    *   *Reality:* The Flynn Effect primarily reflects changes in test bias/specific factors, not necessarily *g* (general intelligence). There is little evidence of "catch-up" growth where developing nations close the gap via the Flynn Effect.
*   **Ad Hominem Shift:** The author notes that critics, upon failing to debunk the data, inevitably shift to insults ("stupid," "moron," "racist") to discourage others from checking the primary sources. This creates a taboo where only those willing to be insulted bother to verify the statistics.
