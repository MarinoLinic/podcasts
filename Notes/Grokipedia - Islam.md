Summary:
The article provides a rigorous academic overview of Islam, the world's second-largest and fastest-growing religion (2.0 billion adherents in 2020). It details the faith's origins in 7th-century Arabia under Prophet Muhammad, the theological centrality of *Tawhid* (monotheism), and the canonical authority of the Quran and Hadith. The notes exhaustively cover the "Five Pillars," the expansion of the Caliphates (Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid) and Gunpowder Empires, and the intellectual history of the Golden Age followed by the "closing of the gates of Ijtihad." It analyzes the Schism (Sunni/Shia), the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (*Madhahib*), and the application of Sharia in family and criminal law (*Hudud*). The text critically examines modern socio-political dynamics, including the rise of Islamism (Muslim Brotherhood, Iranian Revolution), the empirical underperformance of Muslim-majority states in HDI and scientific output, and controversial doctrines regarding apostasy, slavery, and gender inequality.

### **1. Etymology, Definition & Origins**
*   **Linguistic Roots:**
    *   Derived from the Arabic triliteral root **s-l-m** (س-ل-م), encompassing concepts of peace (*salām*), safety, wholesomeness, and submission.
    *   This root appears over **140 times** in the Quran.
    *   *Distinction:* While related to the Hebrew *shalom*, the religious term *Islam* specifically denotes **voluntary submission** (*istislām*) to the will of Allah, rather than pacifism.
*   **Theological Definition:**
    *   Islam is framed not as a new religion but as the primordial path of all prophets (Abraham, Moses, Jesus).
    *   **Quran 3:19:** "Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam."
    *   **Quran 3:85:** "And whoever desires other than Islam as religion—never will it be accepted from him."
*   **Historical Emergence:**
    *   The proper noun *Islam* emerged with the Quranic revelations (610 CE).
    *   Pre-Islamic usage of *s-l-m* in pagan treaties referred to truce or physical surrender (*sulh*).
    *   Earliest epigraphic use by Muslims: **691 CE** inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

### **2. Theological Foundations (Aqidah)**

        3.  *Tawhid al-Asma wa al-Sifat:* Names & Attributes (Affirming God's descriptions without anthropomorphism or negation).
    *   **Surah Al-Ikhlas (112:1-4):** Explicitly refutes the "begetting" of God, countering the Christian Trinity.
*   **Prophethood (Risalah):**
    *   Belief in ~124,000 prophets; **25 are named** in the Quran (e.g., Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Saleh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa).
