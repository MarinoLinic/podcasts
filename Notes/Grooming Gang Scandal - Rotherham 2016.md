Summary:
This document is a transcript of sentencing remarks delivered by Her Honour Judge Sarah Wright on February 26, 2016, in the Crown Court at Sheffield. It details the convictions of six defendants—Bannaras Hussain, Arshid Hussain, Basharat Hussain, Shelley Davies, Karen MacGregor, and Qurban Ali—for serious sexual offenses, including rape, indecent assault, and conspiracy to rape, committed against 14 vulnerable young girls (primarily aged 11-15) in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The case is part of the broader Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, where the defendants (predominantly Pakistani-origin men and women) groomed, exploited, and abused girls from unstable homes, local authority care, or naïve backgrounds. The judge emphasizes the systematic pattern of abuse: initial "caring" behavior turning to control, violence, and degradation; victims being passed among abusers or used for debt repayment; and failures by authorities to act on earlier reports. The victims suffered immense psychological harm, including eating disorders, self-harm, anxiety, depression, and lifelong relational issues. The judge applies modern sentencing guidelines while respecting historical maximums, resulting in sentences ranging from suspended terms to 35 years' imprisonment. She praises the victims' bravery in testifying, noting their motivation to prevent future abuse and expose systemic failures.

The offenses involved calculated grooming with gifts, drugs, and attention, leading to repeated sexual exploitation, often in groups or public places like parks and cars. The judge highlights the devastating community impact and applies the totality principle to ensure proportionate sentences. Arshid Hussain received 35 years (for 23 offenses against 9 victims), Basharat Hussain 25 years (15 offenses against 4 victims), Bannaras Hussain 19 years (10 offenses against 7 victims, with credit for guilty pleas), Karen MacGregor 13 years (4 offenses against 2 victims), Qurban Ali 10 years (1 offense), and Shelley Davies an 18-month suspended sentence (2 offenses, considering her own victimhood).

#### Emphasized Specific Examples of Depraved Instances of Torture and Racism

The transcript reveals numerous instances of extreme physical and psychological torture, including beatings, burns, bindings, threats of death, forced prostitution, and gang rapes, often inflicted to enforce compliance. Racism is evident in slurs and degradations that exploit racial differences, portraying victims as inferior "white" girls unworthy of respect compared to "Asian" women. Below is a comprehensive list of the most depraved examples, organized by victim and perpetrator(s), drawing from the judge's detailed accounts:

- **Victim 1 (Karen MacGregor)**: After providing shelter to the 15-year-old, MacGregor got her drunk with vodka, laughed as she fell, and took her upstairs with a man who digitally penetrated her vagina while wearing rings that caused pain and injury. The victim screamed for help twice, but no one responded; MacGregor intended for the man to rape her, leaving her alone and vulnerable.

- **Victim 2 (Arshid Hussain, Bannaras Hussain, Karen MacGregor, Shelley Davies, Qurban Ali)**: This 11- to 15-year-old was subjected to protracted violence: beaten if she refused sex; cigarette stubbed out on her chest; tied up and raped orally, vaginally, and anally by multiple men (up to three a day) at Arshid's command; passed to friends or for debt repayment; dragged into a car boot and taken to London for forced sex with five men; locked in MacGregor's house, assaulted if trying to escape, and forced into sex with men to "repay" hospitality while given heroin by Ali. She became addicted, pregnant at 14 (terminated), and had daily sex with older Asian men under threats of harm.

- **Victim 3 (Basharat Hussain)**: The 12- or 13-year-old was taken from care, forced into oral sex in a car after being told she was a virgin; later sent to a Blackpool restaurant as a "slave" for forced labor and sex with the owner, his son, and others, living in squalid conditions resulting in STIs and nits.

- **Victim 4 (Bannaras Hussain)**: The 12- or 13-year-old in care was initially threatened, then coerced into oral sex in cars; controlled with abusive language and forced compliance.

- **Victim 5 (Bannaras Hussain)**: At 13, pushed onto a bed, clothes removed despite resistance, raped vaginally with ejaculation inside, causing bleeding; later controlled with alcohol and drugs.

- **Victim 6 (Arshid Hussain, Basharat Hussain)**: From age 14, forced to knees for oral sex while called a "white bitch" and "trash" (racist degradation: Arshid claimed Asian women didn't do oral sex due to religion); hair pulled, ejaculated in mouth or on face; made to prostitute in Bradford/Halifax, handle guns/drugs; described as feeling the Hussains "owned Rotherham."

- **Victim 7 (Basharat Hussain, Arshid Hussain)**: At 15, wrists tied with zip ties, hidden in bushes after violence; threatened with house arson (demonstrated by burning a neighbor's house); forced oral sex on multiple men in a Sheffield flat while blindfolded and bound; on another occasion, hands/feet bound, sheet over head, petrol smelled, kicked, shoes set on fire, feet doused with water; heard another girl screaming during sexual activity.

- **Victim 8 (Arshid Hussain)**: From 13-14, controlled with violence and drugs; pregnant, convinced to terminate by Bannaras claiming Arshid had children with "seven English women" (implying disposability of white victims).

- **Victim 9 (Arshid Hussain, Bannaras Hussain)**: From 15 (drug-addicted since 11), supplied drugs then forced into prostitution in Doncaster's red-light area, earning £200-300/night but giving all to abusers; beaten if resisting ("less painful" to comply); taken to a brothel-like house in another town, kept stoned, waking naked amid used condoms after constant sex with strangers.

- **Victim 10 (Arshid Hussain, Bannaras Hussain)**: At 13-14, taken to Sheffield flat for sex with Arshid, then rushed by older men intent on gang rape (escaped); forced oral sex on Bannaras in car near police station, ejaculating in mouth.

- **Victim 11 (Arshid Hussain)**: At 15, taken to a house full of Asian men who attempted sexual touching; kept there for 2.5 hours before release, intended for group exploitation.

- **Victim 12 (Arshid Hussain)**: At 14, anally raped without consent; pregnant at 14 (terminated under prison threats), again at 15 (gave birth); driven to remote locations to evade detection, causing family distress.

- **Victim 13 (Bannaras Hussain, Arshid Hussain)**: From 14, groomed with cannabis, regular vaginal/oral sex; pregnant at 14 (terminated).

- **Victim 14 (Bannaras Hussain)**: At 14-15, driven to secluded Peak District spot, told people drowned there (death threat), forced oral sex under abandonment threat, ejaculated in mouth.

- **Victim 15 (Basharat Hussain)**: Over 13 years from age 15, slapped hard to floor, punched, spat on, told to "dig her own grave" (thought she would die); strangled while sleeping in York, spat in face; called a "slag not worthy of carrying [abuser's] mother's bags" (implying cultural/racial inferiority); threatened to burn brother's house, monitored family; complaints to police thwarted by claimed CID informant.
