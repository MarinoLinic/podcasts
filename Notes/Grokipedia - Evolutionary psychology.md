Summary:
The article outlines **Evolutionary Psychology (EP)** as a theoretical framework that views the human mind not as a "blank slate" or general-purpose computer, but as a collection of specialized, evolved neural circuits ("modules") designed by natural selection to solve recurrent problems in the **Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)** (Pleistocene era). It covers the field's history from Darwin’s predictions to the formalization by Cosmides and Tooby, key empirical findings (sex differences in mating, cheater detection, error management), and its integration with neuroscience and genetics (heritability of traits). The notes also detail the significant controversies EP faces, including charges of "just-so stories," genetic determinism, and ideological bias, while highlighting recent advances in genomic compatibility and high replicability rates relative to other psychological subfields.

### **1. Core Principles & Theoretical Foundations**
*   **The Computational Theory of Mind (Massive Modularity):**
    *   **Premise:** The mind is viewed as a physical system functioning like a computer, but one designed by natural selection. It is not a general-purpose problem solver (tabula rasa); it is a "Swiss Army Knife" composed of functionally specialized mechanisms.
    *   **Domain Specificity:** Mechanisms are "domain-specific" (e.g., a specific module for snake detection, another for language acquisition, another for mate selection). They are activated by specific environmental inputs and generate specific adaptive outputs.
    *   **The Five Principles (Cosmides & Tooby):**
        1.  The brain is a physical system.
        2.  Neural circuits were designed by natural selection to solve problems.
        3.  Consciousness is just the "tip of the iceberg"; most processing is unconscious.
        4.  Different neural circuits are specialized for different adaptive problems.
        5.  Our modern skulls house a Stone Age mind.
*   **The Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA):**
    *   **Definition:** The EEA is not a specific place (like the African Savanna) or exact time, but the **statistical composite of selection pressures** and environmental regularities that existed during the period when an adaptation was shaped (roughly the Pleistocene, 2.5 MYA to 10,000 years ago).
    *   **Context:** Small-scale hunter-gatherer bands (25-50 people), high mortality, face-to-face social exchange, caloric scarcity.
    *   **The Mismatch Hypothesis:** Modern psychopathology often arises because our evolved mechanisms are mismatched with modern environments.
        *   *Diet:* We crave sugar/fat (adaptive in scarce EEA) $\rightarrow$ Obesity/Diabetes (maladaptive in abundant modern world).
        *   *Fear:* We fear snakes/spiders (ancestral threats) but not cars/guns (modern lethal threats).
*   **Types of Evolved Mechanisms:**
    *   **Obligate:** Develop invariantly across typical environments (e.g., vision, universal grammar).
    *   **Facultative:** "If-then" programs that calibrate to local conditions (e.g., callousing of skin, adjusting mating strategy based on local sex ratio).
    *   **Darwinian Selection Pressures:**
        *   *Natural Selection:* Survival advantages (predator avoidance, foraging).
        *   *Sexual Selection:* Reproductive advantages (intrasexual competition, intersexual choice).
        *   *Kin Selection (Hamilton’s Rule):* Altruism evolves if $rB > C$. Genes promote their own propagation by aiding relatives.

### **2. Historical Development**
*   **Precursors:**
    *   **Charles Darwin (1859/1871):** In *The Descent of Man* and *The Expression of the Emotions*, he argued that mental faculties (reason, emotion, morality) evolved via natural selection just like physical traits.
    *   **William James (1890):** Argued that humans have *more* instincts than animals, not fewer, and that these instincts (like fear) are specialized adaptations.
*   **Foundational Era (Late 1980s-1990s):**
    *   **The Shift from Sociobiology:** Unlike E.O. Wilson’s Sociobiology (which focused on measuring fitness maximization), EP focuses on the **psychological mechanisms** (the "black box") that produce behavior.
    *   **Leda Cosmides & John Tooby:** The "parents" of modern EP. Developed the "Cheater Detection" hypothesis and established the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at UCSB.
    *   **HBES (1988):** Founding of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society at the University of Michigan.
    *   **The Adapted Mind (1992):** The seminal book that defined the field's manifesto against the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM/Blank Slate), arguing that culture is the *product* of evolved mechanisms, not the molder of the mind.
    *   **David Buss:** Conducted the massive 37-culture study (1989) establishing universal sex differences in mate preference.
    *   **Daly & Wilson (1988):** Published *Homicide*, applying evolutionary logic to violence (e.g., the "Young Male Syndrome" and stepparent risk).

### **3. Empirical Paradigms & Validation**
*   **The Wason Selection Task (Cheater Detection):**
    *   *The Paradigm:* A logic puzzle involving "If P then Q."
    *   *Abstract Logic Results:* When presented with numbers/letters ("If vowel, then even number"), success rates are **10-20%**. Humans are poor at abstract logic.
    *   *Social Contract Results:* When the *exact same logic* is framed as a social rule ("If you take the benefit, you must pay the cost"), success rates jump to **65-80%**.
    *   *Conclusion:* Humans possess a specialized **Cheater Detection Module** designed for policing social reciprocity, not a general logic module.
*   **Mate Choice & Sexual Selection:**
    *   **Parental Investment Theory (Trivers):** The sex that invests more (females: 9 months gestation + lactation) is the limited resource and is choosier. The sex that invests less (males) competes for access.
    *   **Universal Preferences (Buss Study, N=10,047):**
        *   **Men:** Universally value youth and physical attractiveness (cues for fertility). Prefer partner variety.
        *   **Women:** Universally value status, ambition, and financial prospects (cues for provisioning). Rated these 2.5x higher than men did.
    *   **Jealousy:**
        *   **Men:** Exhibit stronger physiological distress (heart rate/skin conductance) to *sexual* infidelity (due to paternity uncertainty risks).
        *   **Women:** Exhibit stronger distress to *emotional* infidelity (due to risk of resource diversion).
*   **Error Management Theory (EMT):**
    *   **Bias as Adaptation:** Cognitive biases are not "flaws" but adaptive design features to minimize the *cost* of errors under uncertainty.
    *   *Example 1:* **Sexual Overperception Bias**. Men overestimate female sexual interest because a "false positive" (thinking she likes you when she doesn't) costs little (rejection), but a "false negative" (missing a mating opportunity) is a huge genetic cost.
    *   *Example 2:* **Smoke Detector Principle (Anxiety)**. It is better to have a false alarm (fear of a stick thinking it's a snake) than to miss a real snake. The cost of a "miss" is death.

### **4. Genetics & Neuroscience Integration**
*   **Heritability & Behavioral Genetics:**
    *   **Twin Studies:** Converging evidence shows Intelligence ($h^2 \approx 0.5-0.8$) and Personality ($h^2 \approx 0.4-0.6$) are highly heritable.
    *   **Implication:** This refutes the "Blank Slate" cultural determinism model. Psychological traits have a biological basis subject to selection.
    *   **Gene-Environment Interaction:** Heritability does not imply immutability. Genes create mechanisms that respond to environmental inputs (e.g., aggression heritability is modulated by SES).
*   **Neuroscience Alignment:**
    *   **Amygdala:** Shows specialized activation for ancestral threats (snakes/spiders) and social contract violations, supporting the modularity hypothesis.
    *   **Sex Differences:** Structural dimorphisms in the hypothalamus (larger in men) and limbic connectivity align with adaptations for male-male aggression and female empathy/bonding.
*   **Genomics:**
    *   **GWAS:** Polygenic scores predict behavioral traits (educational attainment, risk-taking, age at first birth), confirming the genetic architecture of psychology.
    *   **Purifying Selection:** Recent analyses (2024) show negative selection on maladaptive behavioral alleles (e.g., high impulsivity), supporting the idea that behavior is under active evolutionary pressure.

### **5. Key Adaptations (Domains)**
*   **Survival & Foraging:**
    *   **Disgust:** The "Behavioral Immune System." Universal aversion to feces/rot prevents pathogen infection. Neuroimaging shows dedicated insula circuits.
    *   **Phobias:** "Prepared Learning" makes it easy to condition fear of ancestral threats (snakes, heights) but difficult to condition fear of modern ones (cars, outlets).
    *   **Foraging:** "Incentive Hope" mechanisms amplify persistence in searching for food when rewards are intermittent.
*   **Social Exchange & Cooperation:**
    *   **Reciprocity:** "Tit-for-Tat" is the optimal strategy for cooperation. It requires the ability to recognize individuals, remember interaction history, and punish defectors.
    *   **Coalitional Psychology:** Humans have specialized modules for detecting "Us vs. Them" alliances. This underpins the "Parochial Altruism" observed in war and politics.
*   **Kin Selection & Parenting:**
    *   **The Cinderella Effect (Daly & Wilson):** Stepparents are statistically much more likely (up to **100x** higher risk) to abuse/kill children than genetic parents. This aligns with the lack of genetic investment.
    *   **Alloparenting:** Grandmaternal investment (especially maternal grandmothers, due to absolute certainty of lineage) significantly boosts grandchild survival.
    *   **Discriminative Parental Solicitude:** Parents invest more in offspring with higher reproductive potential or when resources are abundant (Facultative adaptation).

### **6. Gene-Culture Coevolution & Universals**
*   **Human Universals (Donald Brown):**
    *   Identified 300+ traits found in *every* culture (e.g., incest taboo, color terms, male-dominated coalitional violence, baby talk, status hierarchies).
    *   Universality implies species-typical neural architecture.
*   **Evoked vs. Transmitted Culture:**
    *   **Evoked Culture:** Cultural differences arising from the *same* gene responding to *different* environments.
        *   *Example:* Societies with high pathogen prevalence exhibit higher xenophobia and stricter sexual mores (adaptive defense against disease).
    *   **Transmitted Culture:** Ideas passed via social learning.
*   **Coevolution Models:**
    *   **Lactase Persistence:** A prime example of "Culture First." The cultural invention of dairy farming created selection pressure for the *LCT* gene (lactose tolerance), which then spread through the population.
    *   **Dual Inheritance Theory:** Genes and culture evolve in parallel, influencing each other (e.g., language genes facilitating culture, culture selecting for social brains).

### **7. Controversies & Criticisms**
*   **"Just-So Stories" (Unfalsifiability):**
    *   *Critique:* Stephen Jay Gould and others argued EP invents plausible evolutionary reasons for any behavior after the fact without fossil evidence for the mind.
    *   *Rebuttal:* EP makes **a priori** predictions (e.g., sex differences in jealousy were predicted *before* the data was collected) that are then tested. Failed hypotheses (like certain sperm competition claims) are discarded.
*   **Genetic Determinism:**
    *   *Critique:* EP implies biology is destiny and justifies the status quo (sexism/hierarchy).
    *   *Rebuttal:* EP emphasizes **interactionism** and phenotypic plasticity. Explaining a behavior (e.g., violence) does not justify it (Naturalistic Fallacy). Conversely, assuming equality is "natural" is the Moralistic Fallacy.
*   **WEIRD Samples:**
    *   *Critique:* Most psychology is based on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic samples.
    *   *Rebuttal:* EP is actually the subfield *most* dedicated to cross-cultural validation (e.g., Shuar, Hadza, Tsimane studies) to find universals.
*   **Ideological Resistance:**
    *   *Solution Aversion:* Studies show that acceptance of EP findings correlates negatively with liberal political ideology. Critics often reject findings not because of method, but because the implications (e.g., inherent sex differences) conflict with egalitarian "blank slate" beliefs.

### **8. Replicability & Future Directions**
*   **Replication Crisis:**
    *   While social psychology (priming, stereotype threat) has faced a massive replication crisis (~36% replication rate), Evolutionary Psychology fares significantly better.
    *   **Z-Curve Analysis:** Recent meta-analyses suggest EP journals have a replicability estimate of **~70-72%**.
    *   *Reason:* EP is grounded in a strong metatheory (Biology) rather than loose intuition, constraining hypotheses to those that are biologically plausible.
*   **Future Frontiers:**
    *   **Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience:** Mapping modules to specific neural circuits.
    *   **AI Integration:** Using evolutionary algorithms to simulate how cooperative strategies or cognitive modules evolve *in silico*.
    *   **Computational Modeling:** Testing adaptationist claims against "drift" or "byproduct" explanations using big data simulations.
