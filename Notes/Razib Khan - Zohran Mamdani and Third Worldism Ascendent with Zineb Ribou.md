Summary:
The discussion centers on the rise of **Zohran Mamdani**, a New York politician who represents a shift from traditional identity politics to **"Third Worldism."** Zineb Riboua and Razib Khan argue that Mamdani is not an Islamist or a standard Socialist, but an ideological descendant of the **Algerian Revolution**—using Islam as a revolutionary language against "Western Imperialism." The conversation connects this domestic political trend to global instability, specifically how Russia and China weaponize "anti-colonial" guilt to weaken US resolve, and how the American Right has inadvertently adopted similar "victimhood" structures ("Chud Third Worldism"). The episode concludes with a pessimistic outlook on Western cultural amnesia, the "un-solving" of societal problems like crime due to a lack of historical memory, and the strategic paralysis caused by viewing history through a binary oppressor/oppressed lens.

### **1. The Figurehead: Zohran Mamdani & The New Elite**
*   **Biography & Class Background:**
    *   **The "Nepo Baby" & "Trustafarian":** Mamdani is the son of famous filmmaker **Mira Nair** (who passed up directing blockbusters like *Harry Potter* to maintain artistic integrity) and Columbia Professor **Mahmood Mamdani** (a prominent scholar in post-colonial studies). He grew up in New York, lived a peripatetic life (including a stint as a rapper), and fits the "Trustafarian" archetype—wealthy, drifting, and eventually finding purpose in radical politics.
    *   **The "High Bourgeois" Origin:** Despite his socialist branding, his father’s family comes from the Indian minority in Uganda (Gujarati/Khoja background). This group was historically the merchant and industrial class of East Africa, placing Mamdani firmly in the global elite rather than the proletariat he claims to represent.
    *   **Election Prospects:** At the time of recording, prediction markets placed him as the overwhelming favorite (91 cents on the dollar) to become the next Mayor of New York.
    *   **The "Spoiler" Phenomenon (Zelnor Myrie):** Discussion on candidates like Zelnor Myrie who stay in races despite low odds to secure matching funds or avoid personal debt (similar to John Anderson in 1980), inadvertently shaping the field for frontrunners like Mamdani.
*   **The "Obama" Successor:**
    *   **The "Next Model":** Riboua argues Mamdani is viewed by the Democratic establishment (and implicitly Obama) as the future of the party.
    *   **The Charisma of the Exotic:** Like Obama, he is a "Third Culture Kid"—exotic yet local, speaking the language of the university while holding an outsider's critique. He uses charisma to mask radical policy, possessing a natural "flare" for performance inherited from his filmmaker mother.
    *   **The Evolution of Grievance:** The Democrats are facing an "exhaustion" of previous talking points (racial grievance, gender ideology, "healthcare for all"). These have lost electoral potency. Mamdani represents the **new software update**: "Third Worldism" or "Anti-Imperialism," which serves as a fresh vessel for mobilizing the base.

### **2. Defining the Ideology: Third Worldism vs. Islamism**
*   **The Misdiagnosis:** Conservatives often mislabel Mamdani as a "secret Jihadi" or a "Communist." This is incorrect. He is not a Sunni Islamist (likely culturally Shia/Ismaili) and his lifestyle is secular/cosmopolitan (e.g., his wife does not cover her hair).
*   **The Algerian Revolution Model (1954–1962):**
    *   **Intellectual Lineage:** Riboua contends Mamdani’s ideology draws from the **Algerian War of Independence**, a conflict that radicalized French intellectuals like **Jean-Paul Sartre** and **Frantz Fanon**.
    *   **The Pivot from Stalinism:** In the 1950s/60s, the Western Left was disillusioned with the Soviet Union (Stalinism/Leninism). The Algerian war provided a new cause: a **Global Anti-Colonial Struggle**. This shifted the focus from the "Proletariat vs. Bourgeoisie" to "Colonized vs. Colonizer."
    *   **Purification:** The Algerian struggle was about "purifying" the land of the settler. This ethos migrated to France, contributing to the **May 1968** uprisings, and eventually to American universities, where it became the dominant lens for international relations.
*   **Islam as a Tool (Language vs. Law):**
    *   **Materialism:** Mamdani is a materialist. He uses religion as a tool for political mobilization, similar to how 19th-century French socialists used Catholicism.
    *   **Islam as Language:** For Third Worldists, Islam is the "language of the oppressed." It is weaponized to signal victimhood and resistance against the West.
    *   **The Voting Split:** Mamdani does *not* win the religious Muslim vote. Religious Muslims revere the "Merchant" and the "Warrior"—archetypes of success, honor, and commerce (like the Prophet Muhammad). They reject the "Victim" archetype promoted by Third Worldism. Consequently, Mamdani polls highest (71%) with the **"No Religion"** demographic—secular, university-educated elites who view Islam as an aesthetic of resistance.

### **3. The "Trap" of Anti-Imperialism**
*   **The Definition of Imperialism:**
    *   **Generic vs. Specific:** Historians recognize "generic imperialism" (Mongols, Aztecs, Arabs). However, Third Worldism focuses exclusively on **European Imperialism** (19th/20th Century).
    *   *The Aztec Example:* The Aztecs were brutal imperialists conquered by indigenous armies led by Spaniards, yet in the Third Worldist narrative, only the European element is vilified.
*   **The Policy of Guilt:**
    *   **The Mechanism:** The goal is to establish **historical guilt** to justify modern resource transfers. "You are rich because you stole from us; therefore, you must give it back."
    *   **The NGO Grift:** Narratives like "Western imperialism caused climate change" are used to demand infinite funding for NGOs in the Global South. This ignores local structural failures or corruption, framing every failure of the developing world as a crime committed by the West.
*   **The Trap for Conservatives:**
    *   By arguing against Mamdani on "Islamist" grounds, Conservatives fail. They do not understand that Mamdani’s framework renders the US and Israel as *a priori* evil.
    *   **The "University Pipeline":** This ideology has been "cooking" in universities for 50 years. It provides a pre-packaged moral framework for young voters who feel the "exhaustion" of standard Democrat talking points.

### **4. Geopolitics: The Sahel & The Southern Flank**
*   **The Russian Pincer Strategy:**
    *   Russia is executing a grand strategy against Europe via two fronts:
        *   *Eastern Flank:* High-intensity conventional war in Ukraine.
        *   *Southern Flank:* Destabilizing the Sahel (Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso) via the Wagner Group to push waves of weaponized migration and terrorism into Europe.
*   **Terrorism as a Geopolitical Tool:**
    *   **Exacerbation:** Russia does not fight terrorism in the Sahel; it **exacerbates** it. Russian brutality acts as a recruitment tool for Al-Qaeda, who position themselves as defenders against the "new white colonizers" (Russians).
    *   **Ethnic Tensions:** Unlike the Middle East, Al-Qaeda in the Sahel exploits local ethnic tensions (lighter-skinned Northerners vs. darker-skinned Southerners) rather than just theology.
*   **US Impotence & Proxies:**
    *   Direct US intervention is no longer viable due to high anti-Western sentiment fueled by Russian/Chinese information warfare.
    *   **The Proxy Solution:** The US must work through regional powers like **Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria** to contain the spread of Jihadism.
*   **Demographic Tides:**
    *   While the core Middle East is aging (dampening revolutionary energy), the Sahel has exploding birth rates (e.g., Mali's fertility rate is **5.61** vs. global collapse). This demographic pressure ensures the region will remain a global security nightmare.
*   **Trump’s "Neutralization" Strategy (Gaza):**
    *   Riboua notes the Trump strategy regarding Gaza is not to "solve" it, but to "neutralize" it. By quieting the issue, the US can resume talks with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, for whom Gaza is a domestic political obstacle preventing alliance against Iran/Russia.

### **5. The "Right-Wing Third Worldism"**
*   **The Horseshoe Theory:** The American Right has inadvertently adopted the structure of Third Worldist grievance ("Chud Third Worldism").
    *   **Old Right (15-20 years ago):** "Bootstrap" mentality, pro-competition, "work harder." Immigration was viewed as a competition challenge, not a victimhood grievance.
    *   **New Right (MAGA/Populist):** "They are taking our jobs" (South Park style), "The system is rigged against us," "We are victims of a globalist occupation."
*   **Structural Similarity:**
    *   **The Enemy Within:** The Woke Left views the state as "Imperialist/White Supremacist." The Populist Right views the state as "Globalist/Zionist Controlled."
    *   **Conclusion:** Both sides now view the American state as fundamentally evil or occupied.
*   **Information Warfare Vulnerability:**
    *   This shared anti-institutionalism makes the US uniquely vulnerable to external subversion. Rivals like China and Russia amplify *any* narrative that says "The US is evil/illegitimate."
    *   *The Tech Consequence:* If the US population believes their country is evil, they are less likely to resist Chinese technological encroachment (e.g., Huawei/TikToK infrastructure in the Gulf or West), accepting a narrative that "American decline is justice."

### **6. Cultural Amnesia & The "Un-Solving" of Problems**
*   **The Loss of Cultural References:**
    *   **The "Hollow" Student:** Riboua notes that current university students lack cultural anchors—they don't know history (WWI/WWII), don't listen to albums (only TikTok snippets), and don't watch films. Their register of references is incredibly small.
    *   **The "Marxist Space":** Riboua anecdotes finding a Twitter Space dedicated to the "Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin-Mao Institute" celebrating the October Revolution, only to realize the speakers were all young Americans roleplaying 1917, totally disconnected from the historical reality of these regimes.
*   **The Crime Wave Analogy:**
    *   **The Cycle:** The US "solved" the high crime of the 1970s-90s through policing and incarceration.
    *   **The Amnesia:** A generation (Millennials/Gen Z) that never experienced the crime wave assumed safety was the natural default state of nature, rather than a maintained condition.
    *   **The Un-Solving:** In 2020, society dismantled the mechanisms of safety (bail reform, de-policing), leading to a resurgence of crime.
    *   *Conclusion:* Without historical memory, societies are doomed to "un-solve" solved problems because they forget why the solutions were implemented in the first place.

### **7. The Cosmopolitan Betrayal**
*   **Paul Nizan's "The Watchdogs":**
    *   Riboua references Paul Nizan (a communist who hated Sartre) and his book *The Watchdogs*.
    *   **The Critique:** Nizan/Marx argued that the "Cosmopolitan" (the universalist intellectual) is actually the ultimate agent of Capital. They strip away local identity to create a frictionless world for money.
    *   **Modern Application:** Mamdani and the modern "DEI/Third Worldist" elite fit this Marxist critique perfectly. They are wealthy cosmopolitans using the language of the oppressed to consolidate power for a globalized elite, ultimately serving the interests of capital while claiming to fight it.
    *   **Anti-Semitism Variant:** Mamdani's anti-semitism is framed not as religious hatred, but as "Anti-Imperialism." This makes it palatable to the secular Left, painting Israel as the "White Settler" outpost in the Brown world, fitting neatly into the Third Worldist binary.
