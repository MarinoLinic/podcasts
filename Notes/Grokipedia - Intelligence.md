Summary:
This text provides a rigorous scientific overview of intelligence, defined primarily through the general factor (*g*), a statistically derived construct explaining the positive correlations among diverse cognitive abilities. It details the high heritability of intelligence (rising from ~40% in childhood to ~80% in adulthood via the Wilson Effect), its biological roots in neuroanatomy (brain volume, white matter integrity), and its strong predictive validity for life outcomes including income, health, longevity, and criminality. The notes cover controversial but empirically supported topics such as sex differences in variability, racial/ethnic gaps in average IQ (and the failure of shared-environment explanations to close them), and dysgenic fertility trends. Finally, it contrasts Biological Intelligence (embodied, efficient, causal) with Artificial Intelligence (statistical, brittle, energy-intensive) and dismisses alternative theories like "Multiple Intelligences" or "Plant Neurobiology" as scientifically unsubstantiated.

### **1. Conceptual Foundations & Historical Evolution**
*   **Etymology & Definition:**
    *   **Roots:** Derived from Latin *intelligere* (compound of *inter-* "between" and *legere* "to choose/gather"). The etymology implies the capacity to discern, discriminate, or select among options.
    *   **Modern Definition:** Intelligence is the mental capacity to reason abstractly, solve problems, adapt to novel environments, and learn from experience. It is distinct from domain-specific skills (like rote memorization) or mere knowledge accumulation.
*   **Historical Perspectives:**
    *   **Greek Philosophy:** Plato viewed intelligence as an innate quality of the "philosophical guardians." Aristotle differentiated between *nous poietikos* (active intellect, abstract) and sensory perception.
    *   **Enlightenment Debate:** Descartes defined it as *cogitatio* (thinking substance). Locke argued for *tabula rasa* (sensory experience). Kant synthesized these, defining intelligence via "synthetic a priori judgments" (mechanisms allowing causal inference).
*   **The *g* Factor (General Intelligence):**
    *   **Discovery:** Identified by Charles Spearman in 1904 using factor analysis.
    *   **The "Positive Manifold":** Spearman observed that performance correlations across unrelated cognitive tasks (e.g., sensory discrimination, math, vocabulary) are consistently positive. This shared variance is *g*.
    *   **Statistical Power:** *g* accounts for **40-50%** of the variance in IQ test performance and is the "active ingredient" in predicting real-world outcomes.
    *   **Hierarchical Structure (Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory):**
        *   **Stratum III:** *g* (General Intelligence).
        *   **Stratum II (Broad Abilities):** Includes **Fluid Reasoning (Gf)** (novel problem solving, peaks early), **Crystallized Knowledge (Gc)** (accrued culture/vocabulary), **Visual-Spatial (Gv)**, and **Processing Speed (Gs)**.
        *   **Stratum I:** Narrow, specific abilities.

### **2. Psychometrics: Measurement, Reliability & Validity**
*   **Evolution of Testing:**
    *   **Binet-Simon (1905):** Created to identify French schoolchildren needing remedial help.
    *   **Stern (1912):** Formalized the "Mental Quotient" (Mental Age / Chronological Age × 100).
    *   **Terman (1916):** Standardized the Stanford-Binet in the US, establishing IQ as a classification metric.
    *   **Wechsler (1939):** Introduced "Deviation IQ" to fix scoring issues in adults.
*   **Operationalization (IQ):**
    *   **The Metric:** Scores are forced into a normal distribution (Bell Curve).
    *   **Norms:** Mean = 100, Standard Deviation (SD) = 15.
    *   **Distribution:** ~68% score between 85–115; ~95% between 70–130.
*   **Reliability & Validity:**
    *   **Internal Consistency:** Cronbach’s alpha > 0.90 for major batteries (WAIS-IV).
    *   **Test-Retest Reliability:** Extremely high ($r > 0.90$) even over intervals of years.
    *   **Predictive Validity:**
        *   **Job Performance:** Correlation $r \approx 0.51$ (uncorrected) to $0.65$ (corrected). It predicts performance better than interviews, references, or education level.
        *   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):** Childhood IQ predicts adult income ($r \approx 0.40$) better than parental SES does.
        *   **Mortality:** One SD increase in IQ correlates with a 20-25% reduction in all-cause mortality (up to age 79).
*   **Critique of Alternative Theories:**
    *   **Multiple Intelligences (Gardner):** Scientifically rejected ("neuromyth"). Factor analysis consistently collapses Gardner's categories back into *g*. "Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence" is better described as motor coordination, not intelligence.
    *   **Emotional Intelligence (Goleman/Mayer-Salovey):** Poor psychometrics. Ability-based EI has low reliability ($<0.80$). Self-report EI correlates too strongly ($r > 0.50$) with personality traits like Agreeableness and Extraversion, lacking incremental validity over IQ + Personality.
    *   **Plant "Intelligence":** Plants lack neurons and centralized processing. Behaviors like phototropism or the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism are reflex-like responses to stimuli, not cognitive representations.

### **3. Biological Underpinnings**
*   **Genetics & Heritability:**
    *   **The Wilson Effect:** Genetic influence on IQ *increases* with age.
        *   *Childhood:* Heritability ~20-40% (Shared environment impacts are significant).
        *   *Adulthood:* Heritability **~80%** (Shared environment impact drops to near 0%).
    *   **Mechanism:** Adults select environments that correlate with their genetic propensities (Active Gene-Environment Correlation).
    *   **Twin Studies:** Monozygotic twins reared apart ($r \approx 0.75$) are far more similar than Dizygotic twins reared together ($r \approx 0.50$). Adoptive siblings have a correlation of near 0.00 by adulthood.
    *   **Polygenic Scores:** Intelligence is polygenic (thousands of SNPs). 2018 GWAS (Savage et al.) identified hundreds of loci. Current polygenic scores predict ~6-10% of variance, but this is growing with sample sizes.
*   **Neuroanatomy:**
    *   **Brain Volume:** Moderate correlation with IQ ($r \approx 0.24 - 0.33$). Explains ~10% of variance.
    *   **Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory (P-FIT):** Intelligence arises from the efficiency of the network linking the prefrontal cortex (executive function) and parietal lobes (sensory integration).
    *   **White Matter:** Higher Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in tracks like the corpus callosum predicts higher *g* via faster neural processing speeds.
*   **Evolutionary Origins:**
    *   **Encephalization Quotient (EQ):** Humans have an EQ of ~7.5.
    *   **Metabolic Cost:** The brain consumes 20% of basal energy despite being 2% of body mass. Intelligence was a high-cost evolutionary investment.
    *   **Hypotheses:**
        *   *Social Brain:* Managing groups of ~150 (Dunbar's Number).
        *   *Ecological Intelligence:* Foraging for high-quality food in patchy environments.
        *   *Cognitive Niche:* Co-evolution of language, tool use, and causal reasoning to bypass biological defenses of prey.

### **4. Environmental Factors & The Flynn Effect**
*   **Negative Drivers (Biological Insults):**
    *   **Iodine Deficiency:** Causes cretinism in extreme cases; moderate deficiency lowers IQ by **10-13 points**.
    *   **Lead Toxicity:** Neurotoxic. Childhood exposure (>5µg/dL) correlates with losses of 2-3 points per 10µg/dL. Mid-20th century leaded gas likely reduced collective IQ significantly.
    *   **Prenatal Factors:** Alcohol (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome averages IQ ~70), Smoking (-2 to 6 points), Low Birth Weight (<1500g correlates with 11-13 point deficit).
*   **Socioeconomic Status (SES):**
    *   **Correlation:** High SES children score 10-15 points higher.
    *   **Causality Check:** When controlling for *parental IQ*, the SES effect diminishes. Adoption studies show that being raised in a wealthy home has a negligible effect on *adult* IQ compared to biological parentage.
*   **The Flynn Effect:**
    *   **The Rise:** Global increase of ~3 IQ points per decade (1930s-1990s). Total gains of 15-18 points.
    *   **Nature of Gains:** Gains were largest on **Fluid** tests (Raven’s Matrices), not Crystallized (vocabulary). Likely due to environmental changes (nutrition, disease reduction, schooling in abstract logic).
    *   **The Reversal (Negative Flynn Effect):** Since the 1990s, scores have **declined** in developed nations (Norway, Denmark, UK, France). Norwegian conscript data showed a drop of 0.38 points per decade.
*   **Dysgenics:**
    *   **Fertility Correlation:** Negative correlation between IQ and fertility ($r \approx -0.1$ to $-0.3$). Higher IQ women delay childbirth and have fewer children.
    *   **Impact:** Estimated genotypic decline of **0.8 to 1 IQ point per generation**.
    *   **Global Scale:** A -0.73 correlation exists between National IQ and National Fertility rates.

### **5. Human Variations: Sex & Race**
*   **Sex Differences:**
    *   **Mean:** No significant difference in average *g*.
    *   **Variability Hypothesis:** Males show **greater variance** (Variance Ratio > 1.0). There is an overrepresentation of males at the tails (intellectual disability and genius).
    *   **Specific Domains:**
        *   *Males:* Stronger in Visuospatial tasks (Mental rotation $d \approx 0.9$).
        *   *Females:* Stronger in Verbal fluency, fine motor skills, and episodic memory.
*   **Racial/Ethnic Differences:**
    *   **The Hierarchy:** East Asian (~106) > European (~100) > Hispanic (~89-93) > African American (~85) > Sub-Saharan African (~70). Ashkenazi Jews score highest (~110-115).
    *   **The "Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study":** Tested the "pure environment" hypothesis. Black children adopted by white upper-middle-class families still showed a mean IQ of ~89 at age 17, compared to ~106 for white adoptees in the same families.
    *   **Heritability of the Gap:** Evidence suggests the gap is 50-80% heritable. It has narrowed slightly (from 1.1 SD to ~0.9 SD) but has not closed despite decades of intervention.
    *   **Genomic Data:** Genetic clustering aligns with self-identified race. Polygenic scores for educational attainment show group differences consistent with phenotypic IQ gaps.

### **6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs. Biological Intelligence**
*   **Fundamental Substrate:**
    *   **Hardware:** AI uses silicon transistors (digital); Biology uses organic neurons (analog/electrochemical).
    *   **Energy Efficiency:** The brain operates on **~20 Watts**. Training a model like GPT-3 or GPT-4 requires Giga-to-Terawatt hours. Biology is orders of magnitude more efficient.
*   **Cognitive Architecture & Learning:**
    *   **Mechanisms:** AI uses Backpropagation and Gradient Descent (requiring billions of labeled tokens). Biology uses Hebbian plasticity ("cells that fire together wire together") and "Few-Shot Learning" (learning from 1-2 examples).
    *   **Causality:** AI relies on high-dimensional statistical correlations (predicting the next token). Biological intelligence builds **causal world models** based on physics and embodied interaction.
    *   **Robustness:** AI is brittle (susceptible to adversarial attacks like pixel noise). Biology benefits from evolutionary inductive biases (object permanence, intuitive physics).
*   **Status of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence):**
    *   **The Plateau:** Scaling laws (more data/compute) are yielding diminishing returns. "Narrow AI" (AlphaFold, Chess bots) excels at specific tasks but lacks general reasoning.
    *   **Current Limitations:** AI lacks embodiment, subjective experience (qualia), and intrinsic motivation. It cannot distinguish truth from "hallucination" without human feedback (RLHF).

### **7. Animal Intelligence**
*   **General Factor in Animals:**
    *   Psychometric studies find a *g* factor in mice, rats, dogs, and primates. A mouse good at maze navigation is likely good at fear conditioning.
    *   *Limit:* The "positive manifold" is weaker in animals than in humans.
*   **Comparative Cognition:**
    *   **Mirror Test (Self-Recognition):** Passed by Chimpanzees, Orangutans, Dolphins, Elephants, and Magpies.
    *   **Tool Use:** New Caledonian Crows manufacture hooked tools. Capuchins use stone anvils.
    *   **Continuity Theory:** Human intelligence is a quantitative extension of animal traits, not a qualitative rupture. We share homologous neural structures.

### **8. Ethical, Legal & Social Implications**
*   **History of Abuse:**
    *   **Eugenics:** *Buck v. Bell* (1927) upheld sterilization of the "feeble-minded" in the US based on early IQ tests. Nazi Germany's T4 program used intelligence metrics for euthanasia.
    *   **The Lesson:** Early 20th-century policymakers viewed scores as fixed and ignored environmental confounders (which were larger then than now).
*   **Contemporary Policy Debates:**
    *   **Employment:** *Griggs v. Duke Power* (1971) restricted the use of IQ tests in hiring if they caused "disparate impact" by race, despite IQ being the highest valid predictor of job performance.
    *   **Meritocracy:** The high heritability of IQ implies that inequality of outcome is partly rooted in genetic luck, challenging purely redistributionist or "blank slate" policy models.
    *   **Ideological Conflict:** James Watson (DNA co-discoverer) was ostracized for suggesting genetic roots to the Africa-Europe IQ gap. The scientific consensus (differences are heritable) is frequently at odds with the political consensus (differences are environmental).
