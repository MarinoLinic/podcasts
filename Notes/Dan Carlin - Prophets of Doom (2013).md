Summary:
In this episode of *Hardcore History*, Dan Carlin explores the 1534 Anabaptist rebellion in Münster, Germany—a historical event where the Protestant Reformation spiraled into a totalitarian, apocalyptic nightmare. The episode details how a group of radical religious zealots took over a city, instituted communism and polygamy, and descended into madness under the charismatic but sociopathic leadership of Jan van Leiden. Carlin draws parallels between this 16th-century event and modern phenomena like the Manson Family, the Khmer Rouge, ISIS, and the Branch Davidians, illustrating how quickly civilization can dissolve when ideological purity meets absolute power.

### **1. The Historical Context: The "Virus" of the Reformation**
*   **The Printing Press as the Catalyst:**
    *   **Information Revolution:** Carlin compares the invention of the printing press to the modern internet. It broke the Catholic Church's monopoly on information. For the first time, the Bible was available in the vernacular (German), allowing the average person to fact-check the clergy.
    *   **The "Pandora’s Box" of Interpretation:** Once the bottle was opened, Martin Luther lost control of the narrative. If "every man is his own priest," then who is to say the local baker's interpretation of the Apocalypse isn't as valid as the Pope's?
*   **The "Virus" Analogy:**
    *   Carlin likens the Reformation to a mental virus or contagion. Martin Luther’s 95 Theses (1517) released the pathogen. It mutated rapidly as it moved from mind to mind.
    *   **Magisterial vs. Radical Reformation:**
        *   *Magisterial Reformers:* Figures like Luther and Calvin wanted to reform the theology but maintain the social stability. They relied on Princes and Magistrates to keep order (a "Top-Down" revolution).
        *   *Radical Reformers:* The Anabaptists argued that the Bible makes no mention of Popes, Princes, or Feudal Lords. Therefore, the entire social and political hierarchy of Europe was illegitimate and satanic. This was a "Bottom-Up" revolution.
    *   **The German Peasants' War (1525):** A precursor to Münster. Thomas Müntzer led a peasant uprising based on Luther’s rhetoric. Luther, horrified by the chaos, wrote a pamphlet titled *Against the Murderous, Thieving Hordes of Peasants*, urging princes to "smite, slay, and stab" the rebels. This betrayal severed the link between the poor and the Lutheran church, radicalizing them further.
*   **The Anabaptist "Crime" (Sedition):**
    *   **The Issue of Baptism:** In the 16th century, infant baptism wasn't just a religious rite; it was the state's method of census, taxation, and social enrollment. To deny infant baptism and practice **Adult Baptism** was to opt out of the state. It was viewed as treason and sedition, punishable by death.
    *   **The "Third Baptism":** Persecution was rampant. In Protestant Zurich, Zwingli famously ordered Anabaptists to be drowned—a mocking "third baptism." This persecution radicalized the movement, pushing them from pacifism (the "Staff" faction) to violent resistance (the "Sword" faction).
    *   **Melchior Hoffman:** A traveling furrier/preacher who spread apocalyptic prophecies through the Low Countries, predicting the end of the world and identifying Strasbourg (and later Münster) as the New Jerusalem. He was imprisoned, but his prophecy that "Enoch and Elijah" would return created the theological opening for the Münster prophets.

### **2. The Takeover of Münster: From Democracy to Theocracy**
*   **The Setting (A Liminal City):**
    *   Münster in the 1530s was politically unstable, caught in a triangular power struggle between a Catholic Prince-Bishop (Franz von Waldeck), a Lutheran city council, and the powerful trade guilds.
    *   **Bernhard Rothmann:** The intellectual bridge. He was a local preacher who evolved rapidly from Catholic to Lutheran to Radical Anabaptist. His sermons primed the population for the takeover, converting the wealthy women and the guilds before the Dutch prophets even arrived.
*   **The Prophets Arrive:**
    *   **Jan Matthys:** A tall, imposing Dutch baker with a flowing black beard. He cast himself as the Old Testament prophet "Enoch." He was serious, fanatical, and physically terrifying. He preached that the time for turning the other cheek was over; it was time to kill the unbelievers.
    *   **Jan van Leiden:** A 25-year-old tailor, innkeeper, and **actor**. The illegitimate son of a local magistrate, he was a narcissist with immense charisma. He served as the "hype man" or "Marketing VP" for Matthys, utilizing his theatrical background to stage the revolution.
    *   **Bernhard Knipperdolling:** A wealthy local merchant and guild leader who provided the financial backing and legitimacy for the radicals. He became the "sword bearer" and executioner.
*   **The "Democratic" Coup:**
    *   The Anabaptists didn't initially storm the walls; they used the ballot box. They sent runners into the countryside inviting fellow believers to come to Münster ("Come to the New Jerusalem, safety from the Apocalypse").
    *   The city was flooded with radical immigrants. They legally won the city council elections, taking control of the municipal machinery.
    *   **The Mania:** Prior to the final takeover, there were scenes of mass hysteria. People ran through the streets screaming, foaming at the mouth, and seeing visions in the sky. This "religious mania" exhausted the moderate population's will to resist.
*   **The Cleansing (February 1534):**
    *   Matthys declared that all "godless" (Catholics and Lutherans) must accept rebaptism or be expelled.
    *   *The Imagery:* On a freezing day in February, thousands of citizens—including pregnant women and children—were forced out of the city gates into the snow. They were stripped of their property, which was left behind for the cult.
    *   *The Point of No Return:* By doing this, the city committed collective suicide in the eyes of the Holy Roman Empire. There was no turning back. They had burned their boats.

### **3. The Siege and the Descent into Radicalism**
*   **The Bishop’s Response:**
    *   Franz von Waldeck, the Prince-Bishop, was a secular figure interested in tolls and mistresses, not theology. However, he could not let a city rebel. He raised an army of mercenaries (Landsknechts).
    *   *The Circumvallation:* He built a line of earthworks around Münster to starve them out.
    *   *The Irony:* The Bishop had to borrow money from Protestant princes (like Philip of Hesse) to kill Anabaptists. The Protestants hated the Anabaptists more than they hated the Catholics because the Anabaptists threatened the social order.
*   **The Institution of Communism:**
    *   Matthys declared private property unbiblical, citing *Acts of the Apostles* where early Christians held all things in common.
    *   **Implementation:** All doors had to be left open day and night. Money and gold were confiscated by the state. Food was centralized and rationed.
    *   *Totalitarian Control:* This wasn't just economic; it was a method of control. If you rely on the state for every meal, you cannot rebel. Carlin likens this to **Year Zero** under the Khmer Rouge—an attempt to reboot human society by erasing individual identity.
*   **The Book Burning:**
    *   To ensure total ideological purity, the leadership ordered the burning of all books and manuscripts *except* the Bible.
    *   The city’s archives, contracts, property deeds, and history were incinerated in the town square. This severed all ties to the past and legal reality, leaving only the Prophetic narrative. It was an attempt to destroy "cultural memory."
*   **The Death of Jan Matthys (Easter 1534):**
    *   During a wedding feast, Matthys fell into a trance. He claimed God told him to break the siege alone, like Samson or Gideon. He believed he was invulnerable.
    *   He rode out of the city gate with only a handful of men (approx. 12-20). The Bishop’s Landsknechts were waiting. They ran him through with a pike, chopped him into pieces, and placed his head on a pike for the city to see. They played catch with his genitals.
    *   *The Psychological Shift:* The city was devastated. Their direct line to God was dead. This created a massive power vacuum that the sociopathic Jan van Leiden was all too eager to fill.

### **4. The Reign of King Jan: Theater of the Absurd**
*   **The Transformation:**
    *   Jan van Leiden realized he couldn't play the "soldier-prophet" role like Matthys. He pivoted to "Pageantry and Majesty."
    *   He dissolved the city council and appointed 12 Elders (mirroring the Tribes of Israel).
    *   Eventually, a cooperating goldsmith "prophesied" that Jan was to be the new **King David**, ruler of the entire world, destined to slaughter all kings and princes. Jan accepted this "burden" with feigned reluctance.
*   **Polygamy and the "Sexual Revolution":**
    *   **The Demographic Crisis:** Because the men had been expelled or killed in skirmishes, and many new arrivals were women, the city had a 3:1 female-to-male ratio.
    *   **The Decree:** Jan instituted mandatory polygamy. He argued that "be fruitful and multiply" was a divine command. Every woman of marriageable age *must* be attached to a man.
    *   **The Reality:** This was spun as a protective measure for women, but it resulted in mass rape and forced marriage. Girls as young as 10 or 11 were married off.
    *   **The Resistance (Mollenhecke's Mutiny):** A group of mercenaries inside the city, led by a man named Mollenhecke, attempted a mutiny against the polygamy decree. They captured Jan briefly but were overwhelmed by the loyalists (mostly the women who supported the prophets). The mutineers were slaughtered, and Jan personally beheaded the ringleaders.
    *   **Domestic Terror:** Women who refused their husbands or criticized the regime were imprisoned or executed. Jan eventually accumulated 16 wives.
    *   *Divara:* The widow of Jan Matthys became Jan van Leiden's queen. She was reportedly beautiful, intelligent, and fanatical—a "Lady Macbeth" figure.
    *   *Elisabeth Wandscherer:* One of Jan's wives criticized him for living in luxury while the people ate dirt. In a display of theatrical brutality, Jan took her to the market square, beheaded her himself (it took two swings), and then danced around her corpse with his other wives, singing "Glory to God in the Highest."
*   **The Court of Zion:**
    *   While the population starved (eating whitewash, candle wax, and leather), Jan established a royal court of grotesque opulence.
    *   *The Visuals:* He wore robes of velvet and gold made from confiscated Catholic vestments. He wore a crown and a golden chain with a globe pierced by two swords (symbolizing his dominion over the world).
    *   *Public Theater:* He held court three times a week on a throne in the market square, judging the populace. Executions became a form of public entertainment and religious sacrifice. He had theatrical plays performed in the cathedral mocking the Catholics.
    *   *Carlin's Analogy:* This is comparable to the **Manson Family** taking over a major metropolitan area like Seattle, or **North Korea**—a hermetically sealed "reality distortion field" where the leader is God and the outside world is the enemy.

### **5. The Hille Feicken Incident & The Missionaries**
*   **The Judith Archetype:**
    *   Hille Feicken, a young woman, decided she would be the biblical Judith. She would go out, seduce the Bishop, kill him, and bring his head back to Münster.
    *   She left the city in beautiful clothes. However, she was betrayed by the fact that she was wearing "Anabaptist style" clothing underneath or gave herself away. She was captured, interrogated, and executed.
*   **The Suicide Missionaries:**
    *   Jan van Leiden sent out "apostles" to neighboring cities to spread the revolution. He told them they would be welcomed.
    *   They were immediately captured and executed (often beheaded or drowned). This demonstrated the total disconnect between the internal propaganda of Münster and the external reality.

### **6. The Fall and the Ultimate Punishment**
*   **The Betrayal (June 1535):**
    *   The siege had lasted over 16 months. The people were dying of hunger, looking like "walking roots" or mummies. Two men (one named Hans Eck) escaped the city and betrayed a weak point in the defenses to the Bishop—a concrete water gate that could be traversed if the water level was low.
    *   The Bishop’s troops launched a night raid. They infiltrated the city and opened the gates.
*   **The Massacre:**
    *   A brutal slaughter ensued. The Anabaptists, knowing there was no mercy, fought to the death. They barricaded themselves in the market square behind wagons (a *Wagenburg*).
    *   The Bishop promised safe conduct if they surrendered. They surrendered, and the Bishop’s troops immediately slaughtered them. The streets ran with blood.
*   **The Fate of the Leaders:**
    *   Rothmann reportedly ran into the thick of the fighting to die, knowing what awaited him if captured. His body was never identified.
    *   Divara (the Queen) was captured and beheaded. She remained unrepentant to the end.
*   **The Execution (January 22, 1536):**
    *   Jan van Leiden, his second-in-command Bernhard Knipperdolling, and another leader (Krechting) were captured alive. For six months, they were paraded around Northern Germany like a circus sideshow (a "petting zoo of monsters"), shown to various princes as trophies.
    *   **The Torture:** They were brought back to Münster. They were tied to a stake in the town square. The executioners used red-hot tongs to rip the flesh from their bodies.
    *   *The Technique:* The instruction was to tear the flesh but avoid vital arteries to keep them alive and conscious for a full hour.
    *   *The Reactions:* Knipperdolling tried to suffocate himself with his own collar to end the pain; the executioners saw this and tied his head up by the teeth so he couldn't. Jan van Leiden reportedly endured the torture in silence, perhaps disassociating or maintaining his role as the martyr King.
    *   **The Coup de Grâce:** After an hour, their tongues were ripped out with hot pincers, and they were stabbed in the heart with a dagger.
*   **The Cages:**
    *   Three iron cages were fabricated. The mangled bodies of the three leaders were placed inside (Jan in the middle, slightly higher).
    *   The cages were hoisted to the top of the steeple of **St. Lambert’s Church**—the highest point in the city.
    *   **The Legacy:** The birds picked the bones clean over the decades. The bones were eventually removed (some as late as the 19th century), but the cages remain. They are **still hanging there today**, 500 years later.
    *   *The Bulb:* During WWII, the church was bombed and the steeple collapsed. The cages fell. When they rebuilt the church, they repaired the cages and put them back up. Even today, a small bulb lights up inside the cages at night—a permanent, grim warning against religious fanaticism and rebellion.

### **7. Carlin’s Analysis: Historical Rhymes & Human Nature**
*   **The "Cut Head" Heuristic:**
    *   Carlin explores the psychology of the average 16th-century citizen. Why would they tolerate such barbaric torture?
    *   *Order vs. Chaos:* To the average person, the Anabaptists represented pure chaos—a threat to the very fabric of reality. The torture and the cages were the State’s way of reasserting Order. The "Cut Head" is a signal that the nightmare is over and the rules of gravity apply again.
    *   *Quote:* "If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans." The Anabaptists genuinely believed they were ushering in a Utopia of love and equality; instead, they created a totalitarian Hell on Earth.
*   **Modern Parallels:**
    *   **Jim Jones / Waco / ISIS:** Carlin draws a direct line to modern cults. The isolation, the apocalyptic prophecy, the sexual control by the leader, the communal living—the psychological mechanisms are identical.
    *   **The "Martian" View:** If a Martian looked down at Münster, they wouldn't distinguish between the Catholics killing Anabaptists and Anabaptists killing Catholics. It all looks like madness. But to the participants, the distinctions were worth dying for.
    *   **Totalitarianism:** The Anabaptist rebellion proves you don't need 20th-century technology (cameras, microphones) to create a totalitarian state. You only need a narrative that dehumanizes the outsider ("godless") and elevates the leader to a messiah.
    *   **Logical Insanity:** The scary part isn't that they were crazy; it's that they were logical *within their own framework*. If you truly believe the world ends next week, burning money and banning food storage makes perfect sense.
*   **Luther's Regret:**
    *   The Münster rebellion horrified Martin Luther. It forced him to become more conservative and authoritarian. He sided with the Princes against the peasants in the Peasant Wars, realizing that his doctrine of "freedom of conscience" had opened a Pandora's Box that threatened to destroy civilization if not brutally suppressed.
