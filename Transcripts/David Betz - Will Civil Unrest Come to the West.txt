Thanks for everyone for coming. So as
you all know is professor David Betts
and he's a professor of war uh in the
modern world at King's College London.
Um wrote a book called Carnage
Connectivity uh and also recently is has
you kind of blown up across the internet
with your comments about the threat of
all the risk of civil war in the UK
which often is a thing we we hear about
in sort of Twitter world but they
actually have an academic backing it up
with theory and data talking about it is
is been quite um refreshing and I think
quite terrifying for some people at the
same time. Um but so um here today to
give you an opportunity just to speak to
us about that and uh so welcome first of
all and um yeah if you want to just talk
for uh as long as you want really I mean
I the format here is is pretty
open-ended. It's it's a case of if you
coming guys. Yeah, I see.
Um I think that if you want to give some
opening statements and and have a
dialogue or if you just want to talk and
u uh for a while and then we can discuss
at the end, I don't really mind. What
would you prefer?
>> Let's go for an open-ended discussion.
Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. Well, Professor David Betts,
take it away.
>> Okay. Thank you very much that uh thank
you for your introduction and uh for the
kind words. Um, uh, I'd have to admit
that, um, I I'm I'm not a public figure.
I haven't been a public figure until
recently. I'm a basically a a fairly
standard professor of war studies, if
there can be a standard professor of war
studies. Uh and so the recent uh surge
of interest in what I've been saying I
think frankly and not to be too modest
about it has very little to do with my
original insight in the fact that
instead what I am what I am saying in a
particular way is not actually
academically uh exciting in the sense of
being controversial. I haven't created a
new theory. I'm not introducing new new
data that
uh isn't already in the public sphere.
What I think I've done uh is simply
articulate in uh in a structured manner
something that very large numbers of
people already feel already apprehend
and they have they have thought perhaps
am I crazy? Am I seeing something that
other people do not see? Uh am I upset
about something that I ought not to be
upset uh about? Am I unusual? And what
has occurred is I think a fairly large
realiz simultaneous public realization
that they are not crazy and that they
are not uh out of line in being upset at
what is occurring to them.
So fundamentally my thesis is uh that
all of the factors which scholars would
generally accept as being indicative of
the possibility of civil wars occurring
are present in contemporary Europe in a
very ideal manner. It isn't simply the
UK although the UK is very uh is a very
prominent case of this. Uh it is
effectively all of Western Europe and
certainly it it affects uh the big three
in Europe uh by which I mean the UK,
France and Germany uh more or less more
or less uh equally. I will probably talk
mostly about the UK case because I am a
British citizen. I live there. Uh I'm
familiar with that with that language
and embedded in that community. Uh so I
tend to know that um uh better than uh
the other cases but I know the other
cases sufficiently well uh to believe
that this the conditions are not
altogether different.
Um for related reasons uh the United
States is also in this um category of
potent of civil war potentiality but uh
and we can go into this if if if you
wish. I think that the American case uh
has again a somewhat different uh
different character uh and so we
probably should not too much uh general
generalize what I'm about to say which
is mostly focused it must be said on
western Europe and particularly on the
um perhaps particularly on the UK as a
as an example. So coming to what I've
said are the the um the factors the
indicative factors
in no particular order they are these
firstly factionalism in particularly uh
what is called polar factionalism which
is a kind of factionalism which uh which
uh you get when you have passed beyond
issue factionalism. So when people are
arguing over particular issues that are
contentious uh in um in a in any given
society, think of things like the death
penalty or access to abortion or uh
involvement in foreign wars or something
like uh something like that where people
are arguing over the specific issue but
fe uh uh uh but still see themselves to
be part of the same essentially
political community. That is issue
factionalism. And issue factionalism is
more or less normal in a in a society
because people differ on uh differ on
these issues and we have mechanisms for
resolving those differences and having a
a discussion.
Polar factionalism is a kind of
factionalism where people are no longer
arguing principally over the issue per
se. What they're doing is they're
looking to their tribe to their
community for signals as to what their
community believes and then they adopt
that view. This is a this is a kind of
factionalism you get when people are
feeling insecure.
Uh right they and they feel insecure
because the normally functioning
mechanisms for resolving uh contentious
debates are no longer normally function
normally functioning. Uh which is why uh
we we see in cases of polar factionalism
strange cases where people have
radically changed their views from
recent times from the recent past uh to
now where you see well why has this
person or this group flip-flopped on a
particular issue and usually the and
that uh that can sometimes be explained
through polar factionalization.
uh we are now in a period of polar
factionalization. The most obvious uh
the most important as uh uh aspect of
this now is the emergence of avowedly
ethnic political parties which represent
essentially e ethnic uh ethnic uh or
sectarian causes to the virtual
exclusion of any other causes. uh in the
case of the UK for example this uh this
would be exemplified by the five
nominally independent Muslim MPs who for
all intents and purposes are elected on
a Gaza mandate.
The second uh uh indicative factor uh
which is terribly important and might go
first actually uh but it is related uh
to the first one and that is the
perception of status loss by a formerly
dominant majority in society. what in
the literature is referred to as
downgrading
uh or uh sometimes uh as displacement or
in the popular uh popular discourse as
replacement. And effectively uh what
happens in in this case is that you're
on a uh what is the the case now
throughout Western Europe is that on
current trajectory the indigenous people
of Europe will be a minority in their
own um in their own lands by the middle
of the 21st century uh or perhaps a
little bit later. Um I say the middle of
the 21st century because the important
thing is not actually the overall
number. Uh the more important factor is
the youth number. Uh and that is very
close already to a tipping point in in
most places. Uh so which uh people
recognize and powers their sense of
urgency about the situation.
Now there's an inter I think there's an
interesting bit of neural linguistic
programming that is going on here. I
didn't notice it in this specific
audience, but in others uh uh I one one
does with great regularity and you
observe it in that statement when I used
the words indigenous people of Europe uh
which causes people a lot of normal
people to um
uh to raise an eyebrow to to feel to
feel a bit of discomfort
uh as in can you use those uh words
right are not are not the words
indigenous peoples uh reserved for other
people of the planet besides those of uh
of um of Europe, specifically white
people. Uh and that is that's happened
because you uh western culture is one
that has been propagandized over two
generations now into an instinctive
self-abnigation that no other uh people
in the world subject themselves to. No
Chinese audience would react in this
way. No uh uh no Indonesian audience
would uh react this way. No Japanese
audience would react this way. But
Western European peoples do react that
way. Even when intellectually you know
there is no reason why you ought to. uh
that is essentially a a reflex action
which is inculcated in people over a
lifetime of of propagandization is the
proper word uh for what has uh happened
to you what has happened to your uh to
your minds.
The third factor is a loss of faith in
avenues of peaceful change.
And that arises from what I've just said
uh right from the realization that all
of this is happening because not not by
accident but by choice uh specifically
by elite choice over many years which
has created the policies that have
enabled this situation almost always in
defiance of popular opinion. to give
another an example again from the
British case. If you were to look at the
election manifesto post 1945 election
manifestos of the Labor Party and the
Conservative Party in the UK
specifically doing a textual analysis of
their uh statements around the issue of
migration you'll see that this topic
that that consistently
uh no no party has said well we are
going to have uh ma uncontrolled mass
migration.
uh uh mostly what they have said is that
we are going to manage uh migration. Uh
mo uh sometimes what they have said very
explicitly is uh dear voters we
understand your concerns about
migration. Uh we're not going to do that
to you. We are not going to actively
change the demographic of the country.
The reality of course is that they did
exactly that. uh and uh up until
recently they said one thing and did
another. in the UK case uh with the
Blair government uh they more or less
came out into the open and said as a
part of their their national
transformative political agenda they
were going to use migration to change
the country or as it was put by one of
Tony Blair's uh speech writers very
deliberately they were going to use
diversity to rub the uh rights noses in
the dirt and to defeat all of their
arguments essentially by changing the
population demographic of the country
and we're very open about this. Uh the
truth of the matter as is quite obvious
people do not want this right. This is
not a popular political uh uh uh uh
position and there is an increasingly
strong uh and as a result of of this
disjuncture between what people are
promised politically and what they
receive in actuality. There is an
increasingly strong and measured
perception that normal politics does not
function effectively as a solution to
collective action problems anymore uh
because the trust has dropped out. But
politics as a basic definition of
politics is uh the way in which human
beings in in uh in groups solve
collective action problems. I things
that we can't do individually
we organize in in in groups to achieve
in a collective manner.
Politics is essentially about that. Uh
it's finding these collective action
problems and organizing people uh to
solve them in a kind of rule-based and
systematic uh manner.
When politics uh ceases to be able to
solve collective action problems, it
doesn't mean that collective action
problems don't uh don't exist, that they
disappear or that people's wish that
problems uh be solved. Um uh is not is
not uh um um
uh something which they attempt to do in
another manner. That other manner
frankly is uh uh uh in worst cases and
we are now tending to this through uh
violence through direct act through
direct action um through or through
going beyond the law in some uh uh in
some form which may uh include varying
types of violence.
There has also been a profound collapse
in of trust in all institutions but
especially in political institutions.
This is not a matter of debate. Uh this
has been uh trust is something which has
been uh very systematically very widely
studied throughout effectively the whole
of uh the whole of the world but
particularly in the developed world
since the since at least this the end of
the second world war. Um and there's no
dispute that in terms of its trajectory
trust is in decline uh and has been for
a very very long time. Uh it affects all
institutions uh but not all of them
equally.
uh uh uh uh historically speaking,
politicians have been in the lead in
terms of if uh in terms of distrust uh
but other institutions like journalists,
it must be said, uh are are pretty
close, lawyers and the like. On the
other end of the scale, people have
tended to trust uh police, military, um
uh the clergy, uh doctors and and so on.
But even there the decline is uh very
evident. People trust police less than
they did, clergy less than they did,
lawyer um so on uh less than they once
once did very very worries worryingly uh
moreover the recent collapse in trust of
police is very marked. uh uh so we have
this profound collapse of trust in uh in
all institutions in society but
especially in political institutions.
My uh suggestion is that when you hear
the word trust you might might very
reasonably replace it with the term
social capital. Uh social capital is a
kind of core concept of contemporary
sociology. It is essentially to a
functioning society what money is to a
functioning economy. Uh you need social
capital for things to occur. So uh for
things to occur
so socially to move ideas around to work
to get around
uh differences between people and groups
in the society. You need this kind of
well trust effectively is what we're
what we're talking about. Social capital
in other words is in freefall uh
throughout uh the western uh the western
world. It has been diminishing for at
least a generation but it's now rapidly
uh uh diminishing by many measures. And
if you accept the the uh analogy of
social capital being to a functioning
society what economic capital is to a
functioning or what financial capital is
to a
functioning economy then you you may
accept that uh I would argue we are on
the verge of a kind of social
bankruptcy.
The main difference between the west and
places of the world that you might
consider to be more prone to civil war I
in recent uh not just decades in recent
centuries in fact is that the west has
been relatively rich for about about two
or two and a half centuries relative to
every other place uh on on the planet.
On top of that, the west has a uh has in
more or less the the same time, but
particularly I think I would suggest
peaking in the early 20th century had a
culture of obedience which was based on
a relatively strong ability to achieve
consensus within western societ within
western societies and it has usually had
a unified and competent elite.
Um
all things being equal, these factors
normally provide a strong bull work
against uh the outbreak of civil wars.
If you have a lot of wealth, if you have
a lot of money, then you can paper over
cracks in your society. If people are
angry with each other uh and you know
don't want to associate you know you you
can mllify people quite a lot if you
have the money to basically keep them
materially um satisfied. If you can keep
the streets clean. If you can pay for
enough policemen. If you can pay for you
know all of all of the pertinances of
kind of people's expectations of what
modern life is. Um
so if that's breaking down then you have
less wherewithal to paper over those
cracks uh than uh than you once uh did.
That culture of obedience is one that is
also uh breaken breaking down. It has
frankly largely broken down uh uh uh to
my mind. There are various causes uh for
this but a significant one is the very
diminished ability of heterogeneous
societies relative to homogeneous
societies to achieve consensus uh
viewpoints. Homogeneous societies are
generally relatively able to achieve
consensus pos uh consensus decisions
even on very contentious issues like in
times of economic tribulation
or uh or external or internal threat
natural disaster and so on and so forth.
If you have a a homogeneous society,
you're generally better much better able
to draw on people's willingness to
sacrifice collectively
um than is the case in in heterogeneous
in very mixed societies.
Finally, I don't think it's very
controversial to suggest that our
existing elite is not terribly
competent. uh right we have a
generalized uh in fact I would suggest
there is a generalized competency crisis
that is observable you know across a
range of factors but particularly in
political institutions uh as and
associated institutions law but also
just admin uh bureaucratic civil
administration in general uh states are
quite clearly overcomplexified they find
it more and more difficult to do and
more and more expensive to do things
which they once did um consider with
considerably
um
greater ease uh and effectiveness. Uh
and that is but that is uh fundamentally
I would suggest a reflection of elite
incompetence. Secondly, it's also not a
unified elite generally in in in the
past. Again looking at the UK as an
example, one of the great one of as many
people will have observed the UK
relative to its neighbors is um is able
is relatively less civil war prone less
revolution uh prone right people often
contrast the British with the French for
example the Brit the French being and
you might say things like well the
French are more passionate they're more
likely to go out on the street and break
things and um
uh then would uh British people. Um
there is something to this view. But I
think the really important thing about
the British scene is that the British
elite is has generally been very
unified. When they have been faced with
ch with uh with internal challenges,
they've avoided elite defections. uh and
that ability to stay unified in in the
in the face of threat has given the
British political scene is one of the
reasons why the British political scene
over uh at least two centuries now has
been stable relatively stable compared
to uh its neighbors. Um that's also
breaking down. So we can see uh elite
defections both at the high level. Um
now admittedly this is more uh more
obvious in the American case with the
Trump uh uh with Trump being perhaps not
perhaps the exemplary figure of an elite
elite defection. But you're seeing the
same man the same kind of thing
beginning to emerge across uh western
states. You're also beginning to see at
the bottom level elite defection where
uh where the word defection is a bit uh
misleading because in fact what it is is
not defection per se but a failure of uh
uh uh aspiring elite youth to achieve
their ambition in the elite system.
Because there are more effectively there
are more uh more people expecting to
rise to elite positions, elite status,
elite uh uh uh both social status and
material status in society than the
elite structure can absorb. Uh a really
good example of that and again in the
case of the UK was the announcement a
couple of months ago that last year the
number of graduate jobs uh available in
the country had declined by 39% in one
year. uh where are those 39%
uh right where are those people going to
go if they're not going into the uh the
the elite which is the normal absorption
pattern for uh ambitious aspiring uh uh
people who've been trained and educated
and acculturated to think they are uh
elite where are they going to go um
we'll get to that in a moment but I
think the answer is fairly obvious in
short the problem is that all of these
things are breaking down productivity
and the innovation are flat as are real
wages. Uh I'm not an economist but this
is again not a controversial statement.
Economies are overcomplexified and
bureaucratized in frankly rather Soviet
manner.
Debt is gigantic and unsustainable.
heavy energy and uh heavy and energy
intense industries are increasingly uh
more abundant because they can't afford
they're uh economically uncompetitive in
a global uh in a global marketplace.
Moreover, I think that artificial
intelligence has the potential to do in
the next few years to what the white
collar professions what has already
happened to the bluecollar ones over the
last uh generation. i.e. to replace a
bunch of people. The culture of
obedience based on consensus building is
collapsing under the assault of
multiculturalism and identity politics
that have destroyed that robust sense of
a collective we um and that is a
long-term process I would uh say that is
aggravated in recent times by the
fracturing and isolating effects of
social media.
The bottom line is that the political
system is no longer based on a coherent
pre-political loyalty, which means
therefore that it is basically a castle
built on sand. Finally, as I said, the
elite is also beginning to fracture and
see uh u uh defections. I've spoken
about that already, but I'll just
conclude on the point of the the uh the
emergence of significant expectation
gaps. An expectation gap is a bit of
jargon from the from the literature on
contentious politics and uh the theories
on why men rebel and uh for example
which uh refers to a situation where
people expect one thing in terms usually
in terms of their material
uh uh material circumstances, their
material prospects for employment for uh
procreation, to own a home, basic things
like like to uh to enter into a good
profession, things like that. So there
there is a when there is a large gap
between their expectation, what they
think they've been promised
and what they actually receive. Okay. uh
there's academics debate everything and
undoubtedly there is debate around the
new on the on the edges of this but I
think it's fair to say the textbooks all
agree that the emergence of expect that
expectation gaps are really really
dangerous
they produce dangerous situation in
situations now I'll I'll conclude uh
this point anyway uh is that probably on
an individual level
you might now be thinking that things
still seem pretty normal in your uh in
your in your daily life that what I'm
saying does not conform totally with
your personal experience. Although I I
have noted a number of young people
nodding away pretty furiously when I
talked about expectation gap and home
ownership and and employment and all of
the other things while uh some of the
older people in the room uh uh are uh uh
maybe a little sheepish. Um okay but the
the the thing is that what you are
experiencing is normaly bias that is the
situ that the situation is in fact
measurably very tenuous. It would be
good to have a discussion, I would
suggest, with some of your Balkan
friends, if you have any Balkan friends,
uh about pre-laps, pre-lapse area in
Yugoslavia and how quickly that country
went from mostly normal to complete
bedum
uh because that is your situation.
>> Thank you very much. Thank you. Um does
anyone have any questions? I had a few
but what uh
>> well thank you professor. you just talk
about the the balcon but my my question
was really about uh the closest
president in in your research in your
opinion so both in terms of similar
events uh in history in the west
especially or or closest in proximity in
time is it I don't know uh the beginning
of the 19th century New York City or is
it or is it I don't know the Visigots
are sweeping over the Gaul and then
Spain I don't know so migration fueled
um unrest in in the west.
>> This is a good question and um I I'm a
bit reluctant to to uh to to take this
the the uh argument by example or
argument by comparison too far and too
literally in this case and that is that
is uh for for two reasons. Firstly, it's
a cardinal rule in the study of
insurgency and ought to be in the study
of civil war and well, it is in the
study of civil war that they're all so
generous. It's all unique. Right.
Right. When of when you really not ought
not to overgeneralize because it's it's
enormously important with any given one
to understand what is the specific
context. It's and it's uh it it's one of
the most irritating things that
academics do when they're in practical
environments is they talk about you know
they basically they talk about theory
and generalized examples uh uh without
sufficient regard for the specifics of
the of the matter. So I'm very firstly
I'm very
uh um
that that is something that that weighs
on on my mind a lot. I don't want to uh
overgeneralize. I think we can use
historical example uh to illuminate a
aspects of what may be happening. We
certainly use historical example to
generate um you know models of uh and
and theories around things. I
specifically I personally haven't
invented a new model a new model. This
is all basically pretty much standard
civil war causational literature. Um but
I but I do want to stress that we ought
not to
uh uh generalize. We can talk about
these these causes these causes as I've
just mentioned and I think the cons the
the field is not going to argue too much
about uh about those but in any specific
case we need to be very specific very
particular. The second uh thing is I
don't think that the current case
actually is precedented in some really
important respects. Um some of those are
pretty obvious and everybody's going to
nod when I point to social media. I've
already uh point uh pointed at that. The
general connectedness of society is is
different than it had been in the past.
We've always been connected, but we
haven't been connected in quite this
this manner with the ability to move
ideas around and for ideas to expand uh
to uh multiply in scale and in uh
virality
uh in the way that uh in the way that
they uh they do now. Also a key
difference though or and so most of that
is obvious I'm sure uh to everyone so I
won't go on with it. I think it's
boring. Um, but I was going to mention a
key maybe I'll finish the key point and
then I'll come. The key key one is this
is that
within the the civil wars literature
there's a recognition if you imagine a
bell curve right everyone knows what a
bell curve is. Uh and on one end of this
curve uh uh you have um uh stable
democracies and on the other end of the
curve you have stable autocracies or
totalitarian uh you know that and the
curve represents the propensity to civil
war or into internal conflict. In stable
democracies, you don't have a large
propensity to civil war because they're
good at solving problems, right? A
stable de democracy by definition is one
that has a a good well-developed social
habit of solving collective action
problems. And people, you know,
basically get along with each other even
when policy doesn't go in the direction
that they would wish perhaps personally.
Over on the auto
the uh uh stable auto autocracy bit, you
don't tend to get civil war because the
state is very good at detecting
dissident and punishing them um either
hiding them away or punishing them
publicly to scare people into not
following uh that that pattern. The bit
in the middle I the transitional bit
which is neither dem democratic nor
fully uh autocratic is where you get the
potential for where the potential for
civil war um uh is greater uh because
they don't have either of those set
those sets of tool. So the literature is
very clear on that transitional states
are uh ones that are more civil warrone
than non-transitional states. That's not
really controversial. But most of the
literature on transitional states is in
fact all of the literature I dare say on
transitional states is concerned with
states that are moving from uh from
sorry from autocratic forms of politics
to democratic ones. And so, you know,
you might say, you know, if you we would
be having this conversation in this room
in 1992, we might have been saying,
okay,
you know, Hungary is a is a country
which uh possesses certain uh political
challenges that arise from the fact that
it's just spent the last 45 years under
a non-democratic government. So, there's
a whole bureaucracy that doesn't really
know how to operate in in a democratic
environment. you have police that you
have to learn now to you know police in
a cons in a consensual manner and so on
and so forth. Um so that was a case of
transition to transition to a more
democratic form. I would suggest now the
the the issue is that we're we're
transitioning from uh democratic forms
of governments to totalitarian forms of
governments. These are to these are
transitional states. Effectively, the UK
is a transitional state uh uh in terms
of its its place within the literature
on political science when it on
comparative political science. The UK is
transitioning from a relatively free
state. So, no, that's being a disservice
to the UK from a free state to a
relatively unfree one. And that uh I
don't know how much that difference uh
matters in terms of where you are on the
bell curve. It means you're in the
middle of the bell curve. But I think
there are aspects of the that arise from
the contrary direction of travel that
are important to to consider when we say
oh well transitional states are more uh
are examples of of civil warrone states
that we should bear bear in mind because
the direction of tra the direction of
travel is is is different. Sorry that's
my last point.
>> Well thank you very much. Um I kind of
have uh three um um three questions uh
just to push back a little bit and just
be a bit of devil de devil's advocate in
some of the framing as I'm myself uh
grew up in Britain and one is um a lot
of the stuff we're talking about about
loss of status and indeed a lot of the
the strange policing we're having
so-called woke policing and so on. I
wonder how much of that is timelimited
to the extent the last seven or eight
years we've been living in a culture
that has been culturally colonized by
America's moral panics through social
media. And so we've adopted the the
rhetoric the framing of the Americans.
And I've even noticed some of our more
more popular sort of uh political
influences left and right have adopted
the the vernacular of Americans. Even
the manner in which they speak is
American. For instance, even the the
flag movement recently in the UK. The
thing I find odd about it is simply that
it was such an American thing to do,
start flying flags because in Britain we
we were never really and this is not a
political point. That's right. It always
seemed a bit crash to fly a flag for
anything other than the queen's
coronation or something or or a jubilee.
But it was that you didn't see the flag
coming out as a political statement like
you see in the Americans. And when I see
this, I see it as less a cure for things
and more a symptom of how strange things
have got, namely that we're just being
culturally colorized by American
sensibility. That's one thought. Um, so
I wonder how much the problems we're
facing right now are the loss of status
and so on of the majority is just us
being colonized by America's woke
puritan. Americans love to have a state
periods of Puritan mania every now and
again and I think we're being infected
by argu I put that as a a proposition to
be to be uh for your for your thoughts
on that. Secondly, I'm wondering what
your thoughts are around the role of
Brexit in everything because you talk
about the shift from issue factionalism
to polar factionalism and Brexit was the
first time I remember when Brexit
happened in the months after that. It
was the first time I'd ever be able to
look at someone in the UK not according
to class usually in the you can tell
with the UK class distinctions based on
how people dress and so on. But suddenly
I could tell what someone believed on a
political issue based on what car they
drove or what their facial hair was. It
was very interesting. And it wasn't
always correct, but generally I saw a
division that I hadn't seen before. And
that seemed to be a shift to to polar.
My point is not about whether Brexit's
good or bad, but the phenomenon of
Brexit. Was it a transitional experience
issue to polar factionalism? The third
question I have for you is to do with um
precisely this shift from issue to polar
factionism because you could argue maybe
and I'm curious your thoughts on this
that that the opposite is also true that
if you look back to the 20th century far
more people were members of political
parties. I just looked it up and in 1953
the conservative party membership was
2.8 million. Now it's 123,000. Labor was
1 million in 1953. Now it's 360,000.
And so what we've seen is far from
people becoming more polarized, we we
used to have a far more polarized
political party structure. We had Labour
clubs, conservative clubs you drink at,
that was your community. Um, but now it
seems what we then went through was a
period of several decades of purely
issue based politics. All the parties
kind of agreed on a lot of the major
issues, which is what the backlash has
come to. So I'm wondering is the problem
that we are now polarizing or is the
problem was that for a period we stopped
being polarized over fundamental issues?
We thought all the existential questions
had been solved and therefore it was
just technocratic fiddling with the
details tightening a few nuts and bolts.
So, so, so my push back on that would be
the pol the polarization we're seeing.
Is it the exception proving the rule of
issue based normality or was the issue
based period the exception and we're
returning to something more norm.
>> Okay, there's a lot there. I'm not sure
I can get to it all, but I'll give it a
try actually. Uh so I I fully agree that
there is there is um uh as I already
mentioned that there is an aspect of the
connectedness of our of our
kind of human situation uh now that is a
a very important explanatory
uh element of of this and I also think
that uh it's undoubted that certain
aspects of of the of American politics
and American culture which which uh
relate to the American scene and
particularly its its racial uh uh racial
racial and political history uh have
been imported have have been exported
essentially and so it's no you know and
an obvious example of this is uh the the
BLM movement and the reaction to uh you
know George uh George uh Floyd in the
United states touching off uh rioting
not just throughout the United States
but also in in Europe. In one of the
most heavily recorded scenes, you had
um protests in uh Bristol which
culminated with the pitching of uh one
of the kind of city fathers of of
Bristol uh having his his statue pitched
into the uh into the uh into the harbor.
Now, uh I'm the sort of person who
thinks that uh that that kind of scene
is actually terrifically important. That
isn't a bit of normal politics or even
just contentious politics. That's a
scene of icon destruction. Um and icon
destruction is what what happens in
deeply factionalized societies whereas
in fact what you're attacking is the
collective countenance of your uh of
your enemy. when you go out and you
start knocking down stat statues and
symbols um that's not in that's not in
incidental. That is that is a very uh
think of it you in terms of attacks
that's a very subtle knife uh because
it's probing into some very um
uh uh
very important parts uh of the of of the
body. It's not a club. uh it's subtle
but is very very power very very
powerful. So I agree that that that has
uh moved over with respect to the the
flag like like you and I'm I'm an
immigrant. I immigrated to Britain. I've
lived in Britain for uh over 25 years
now. I consider myself to be British. Uh
but you know the fact of the matter is I
still am perplexed uh by certain aspects
of that. The flag is one of them. Um, in
fact, you know, so I've I'm originally
uh originally Canadian. Canadians have
the conceit of thinking that they
understand everyone because they're in
the they're sort of intermediate between
Europeans and Americans. Uh, truth is,
uh, that Canadians barely understand
themselves. Um, but at any at any rate,
um,
uh, there is this, uh, there is this
conceit and their observation, for
example, that the Americans would fly
fly flags all the time. You know, every
middle class American household has a
flag or two on it. Uh, every every, you
know, red-blooded American male has a,
you know, an American flag bumper
sticker on his pickup truck. Okay. This,
uh, this kind of cliche, and, you know,
Canadians do that a half as much as
Americans do it, and Europeans do it
about half as much as Canadians uh, uh,
do it.
So, you know, overt I think it's true
that actually British culture certainly
when I went when I when I first moved
there 25 years ago was not an overt flag
waving culture. Um, and one my
suggestion my feeling was or at least
how it explained to me is, you know,
people felt actually quite confident
about themselves. They felt quite
confident about their flag, about their
country, about who they were. And they
thought they they saw the kind of overt
um American style uh uh uh flag waving
as being a bit crass, but also a bit
unnecessary. Do you really need to, you
know, look at us? Do I need to wave the
flag all around? I'm I'm sitting in a
200-year-old house. I'm I'm in the I'm
in the shadow of the mother of
parliament. Do I need to go around
shoving my superior, you know, flag in
people's faces in an in an overt way?
You know, like when you're really
confident in yourself, then you don't
need these kinds of uh of displays.
Uh now coming to today quite obviously
that is not the that is uh sorry
actually before I come to to to today I
would say even even there though there
was something very curious. I would
notice this. So people would uh a
British person might not would very
unlikely to fly the Union flag off their
house or the St. George's Cross off off
their house unless it's World Cup uh
time in which case then it's then it's
okay. But on a normal basis uh they
would not do so.
Uh, on the other hand, go into Tesco and
get yourself a a prepackaged, not Tesco,
go into Morrison's and get yourself a
prepackaged tuna sandwich and it's
emlazed with the Union flag. You ever
noticed this? How many British products
are basically wrapped in the British in
in the flag? The British like the
British flag is not invisible in British
society. Uh it's often not literally
flying in up, you know, look across the,
you know,
on a very large flag pole in the highest
point of the city, but it's all over the
place. You can't uh you couldn't mistake
it. So I I think one could um maybe over
uh interpret or or or exaggerate a a
difference. I don't think there's
something congenally different about
Britains and Canadians and Americans. In
fact, they all kind of arise from the
same
cultural space.
Coming to today, uh there are flags all
over the country. This is this is the
issue amongst the issues of the day. Uh
in my own my own street in the last week
has been has been flagged. Uh before I
got on my plane to come here, I walked
uh I walked up and down the street on
the normal route I would walk my dog.
Uh, and I counted 160 flags.
Uh, right. I don't have a fastmoving
dog. I don't really He's a very old dog.
I don't go very far. So, that's like a
high density. You know, if you think,
you know, the average dog walk uh and
you see 160 flags, that's a that I think
that's a pretty high intensity. I'm not
saying that's a scientific measure, but
it is a kind of measure.
Uh, and clearly also this is
contentious, right? uh if you uh if
you're involved in the British cultural
space at this moment, you'll have heard
the term flag shagging or flag shagger,
right? Previously it was g right these
are disparaging uh these are these are
uh a disparaging uh description of the
people who are quite obviously involved
in this effort who want to fly their
flag. Why? I would suggest because they
don't feel confident. They don't feel
confident that this is their place. They
don't feel confident that everyone
around them understands you know that
this is a that this is a great country.
It is a is a great shared
accomplishment. It is a country which
ought to which is and ought to be proud
of themselves. This is an expression of
of insecurity and uh both on a kind of
uh a somewhat generic level but also on
a neighborhood level because when you
paint when you flag your street as we
know from Northern Ireland, this is also
about marking boundaries. There are
parts of the town uh that I live in,
which is a medium-sized uh English uh uh
town, where you will find no flags and
no person would go, no person would
certainly go into that neighborhood uh
with the intention of putting a flag on
a lamp post uh because they'd probably
get, you know, they would they would be
attacked. The flag would at at any rate,
the flag would uh the flag would come
down. Uh so you're getting territory
market marking at uh neighborhood
behavior at a neighborhood level.
Suffice to say uh in in in short this is
not a sign uh this is not a sign of good
social health. Uh this is a sign of many
aspects of ill social health of fear and
of the of the perception of the need to
mark one's own tribal territory.
Thirdly, you didn't mention it, but it
has to be mentioned, the rape gangs. The
rape gangs in the UK have transformed
the social space. Somewhere between uh
250,000 and a million girls have been uh
have been raped by primarily Pakistani
origin uh uh
gangs. It can only be uh this is clan
networks essentially if I understand it
correctly. But at any rate, the scale
and the egregiousness is off the scale.
It's multigenerational and it isworked
across uh across the country, which says
to people who at this up up until this
point who have been thinking, well, you
know, maybe the multicultural model is
like, you know, underneath we're all the
same, right? Of course, let's that
maybe being replaced in your own country
is not a very safe thing to occur. If
this is what is happening already before
that has happened, what should you
expect when you've become the minor the
minority?
Uh, of course it's impolitic to say.
It's very uh it's uh uh and it isn't on
the whole a thing raised in polite
company in elite circles. But on the
other hand, why would it be? Cuz it's
not elites being who are suffering in
this manner. It is almost exclusively
white workingclass girls
who uh uh frankly have been pitched on
the bonfire of uh multiculturalism.
they've been sacrificed uh uh to this
and it's still going on finally and you
you mentioned Brexit but
and and it's its importance and I'll
explain that I will speak on that in a
sense but I think already what we can
see across a range of of um
organized social
activities
in British society and other societies.
are where we can see the divisions
emerging and becoming very very concrete
um or very not uh very distinct. Okay.
So one of those it was comes came out of
the Brexit uh debate but it const
basically comes up very very frequently
and it's these two ideas. One is we want
our country back. Okay, you've heard
this phrase or some variation on the
phrase we want our country back. In the
case of the the Brexit campaign, the
signature the most powerful message of
the leave campaign was the take back
control. Okay. Uh
above all the messages, the many
messages that were going out, that was
the one that that uh resonated.
Take back control is another I would
suggest is just semantically it's
basically we want our country back. We
want a a
it's not all that complicated.
On the other hand you get uh you get you
had the remain campaign and generally
speaking the entirety of our power elite
the political establishment most of
media uh nearly all of academia say well
why what are countries for anyway? like
countries are old, you know, like this
isn't the way that people organize
themselves anymore. Countries are
countries are kind of this anacronistic
institution because nowadays what we
have are these super national
organizations, some of which are very
obvious in the form of the EU. uh but
others which are not very obvious but
really terribly important in terms of
like how your c country functions, what
your st standards are for a range of
things, how your money moves around, how
you know all of that sort of so you get
these two these two arguments saying we
want to we want our country back and uh
the other saying like
forget it you know countries are over.
Now we're organizing ourselves in a
different pattern. Um, which
incidentally is one which cannot be
democratic. Um, and we we we can go into
why that is is the case, but the main
thing being is that there's no unified
demos uh to check on its public will. So
Brexit concentrated a lot of that. In
more recent times, we just every week
there is a new event which which
presents that kind of division. One of
the thing ones that you you might have
uh you might have observed uh because it
was you know a big public event was the
Glastonbury Music Festival. The
Glastonbury Music Festival, you have a
music artist. I'd never heard of the guy
before and I've honestly forgotten his
name now. It doesn't matter. But you
know he was saying um uh what was it?
You want your country back? You want
your country back? Shut the [ __ ] up.
Okay. So
very simply, I if you if you want to get
a measure of like where the line is and
who is on what side of it, get a group
of average people in the room and and
say which of the in that door is the we
want our country back uh door, proceed
there, and that door is the shut the
[ __ ] up uh door. Okay? You're going to
you're going to get now and I I think
what's what happens in a polarized
society is you get almost everybody
split to one of those doors. Okay. Uh
uh and that's the situation that's the
situation uh we're that's the situation
um we're in. Now finally on political
parties uh yes I think that's a very you
know a good point with respect to the
decline of mass political parties.
I think that that's a reflection though
of or in the past that's a reflection
though of the the existence of a more uh
coherent political framework.
uh and
that
uh
where we are now uh we don't we
obviously we don't have uh uh um uh mass
parties. We have a proliferation of
parties instead. Um but most of those in
fact are not parties. What what they are
is movements, right? They're they're
they're issue movements. So uh and
a good example of that is UKIP in in the
UK. UK. UKIP is you know yes it is a
political party but essentially it was
an issue movement for um a long time and
fundamentally still is I think probably
reform uh which is uh not now is a
competitor of UKIP frankly but obviously
kind of the kind of leading much much
more significant kind of successor to it
I guess we could one could say. Um, I
think it's more a more of a of a
movement uh than a part than a party.
It's not actually legally a party, I'm
given to understand. It's got a rather
more complicated management structure.
Um,
and I I'm I'm I'm I'm skeptical of its
I'm I'm honestly skeptical of it of its
potential. But I think uh I I take your
point, but I think that's a reflection
of a uh the mass political party was a
reflection of a society that had a mo
more coherent political framework. uh
and the the the mass parties were able
to be uh provide an umbrella for quite a
large uh um
range of political ideas both within the
conser on the conservative and the and
the labor side whereas now they're you
know they're all they're all fracturing
and the mass political parties are in
fact you know uh are very very
diminished in terms of of uh of
membership.
>> Thank you. Maybe you had a question. I
think he was Yeah. Mr. Litswick and I'm
just firstly regarding the flag issue.
I'm I'm not sure if talking about the
American elements of this has much
explanatory power considering the
activities of British identifying
populations in Ireland throughout the
20th century and how fond they are of
using the flag to mark their territory.
It seems to be more a bit of a comfort
thing. But on that issue, do you
honestly think that Western European
countries, especially the United
Kingdom, actually have the capacity for
a civil war nowadays? Considering if we
look at troubles in Northern Ireland,
probably the most equivalent example, it
never got beyond terror campaigns,
bombings, mass cas mass casualty events
due to a limitation of capacity within
those groups as well as the power of the
security state there. And arguably the
two populations there, the two in
relatively indigenous European
populations there were highly integrated
with one another. the cumas were very
strong compared to nowadays a lot of
people are split up and there's a huge
amount of atomizations within major
European populations in their own
countries meaning that their actual
capacity for organiz organized violence
seems to be far far lower and not to
mention the uh movement within Europe to
largely disarm populations. Um, in
Ireland you had a history of arms
struggle that involved, you know, both
legally and illegally obtained firearms
that were gathered over decades. If you
compare that to the UK now, the UK has
relatively low firearm ownership and
those firearms are relatively
um
they're relatively weak compared to what
would be usually used by law enforcement
or militaries. So how would these
populations in any reasonable way like
conduct any sort of civil war?
>> Okay. Uh so the
to the first part of your answer, I
wouldn't be here if I didn't think there
was the potential uh for it to
metastasize into what everyone will
understand and no one would dispute is a
civil war.
Um
uh but I'll now explain uh in reference
to your follow on questions why I think
that uh is the case.
Uh before I do though, I should
stipulate that
ci civil war is a term that it has the
potential to encompass a a very wide
range of contingent contingencies. I
said earlier that they're all, you know,
they're all unique. They all have their
different their specific contexts and I
don't expect that and and this is the
that is the case in in the UK and will
be the case in France and will be the
case in Germany and other places where
this might um
might well uh might well um uh occur. I
don't expect that it is going to look
like the American Civil War circa 1860
uh because the context is is different
and I don't expect you know uh I don't
expect that it is going to look like the
Taiping Rebellion of roughly the same uh
roughly the same time because the
context uh is different but I think we
will have no trouble referring uh to uh
events as they trans as they transpire
as a civil war because It will be an
armed uh an armed conflict conducted by
belligerents who at the in at the
beginning of the conflict were under the
same sovereign authority. Uh which is a
basic
I think a a basic definition of civil
war.
I think in the 21st century uh western
formerly
robustly democratic uh context what we
should expect firstly is something which
is akin to uh which what what usually is
called dirty war uh which is a
descriptor that's usually was coined to
apply to uh Latin American style uh
internal conflict long-term chronic
uh uh uh characterized by um
assassinations, kidnappings,
um uh punishment, beatings, uh and uh
repri uh state or other group reprisals
uh taking the form of disappearances
um and uh essentially death squads,
counter assassinations.
uh the these could be these, as I said,
tended to be chronic. Uh they tended to
be low-level in violence in the sense
that you don't have two armies, one
painted blue and one painted gray, going
at each other, fighting each other with
high-grade military weapons. Uh but you
do get a lot of vi a lot of violence and
deranging violence. So, for example, uh
you might, you know, if you were say in
Guatemala, uh in the late 1980s,
it wouldn't have been and you were
catching a bus to go to school or work,
it wouldn't have been completely unusual
to get on the bus and find two
decapitated heads on the floor of the
bus, which were there as a demon as
essentially as a demonstration. Uh
right. That kind of vi that kind of
violence um
is um is uh
typical of of uh dirty wars. You can
imagine come up with various other
imaginations. Think of u think of
uh Mexico for example with you know
bodies dangling from um overpasses and
uh that sort of uh that sort of
situation. So I think you're in the
first instance you will have the
emergence of a dirty war which will have
a lot of resemblance frankly to what
occurred in uh Northern Ireland which is
sometimes which also sometimes is
referred to as having been a dirty war
of this of this type conducted by
you know terrorism uh par paramilitaries
uh and the like. So just to be perfectly
clear by my definition, Northern Ireland
is a repres is an is an instance of
civil war. It was localized uh within uh
within the larger political entity which
is Great Britain and Northern Northern
Ireland and the British state had the
wherewithal to
more or less contain it. Although the
reason that uh the British landscape,
urban landscape began to change in the
1980s through the 1990s was because they
couldn't fully contain uh the the
violence uh to Northern Ireland. Uh but
in my conception that that's that's part
of it and one should expect that this
phase though of dirty war is uh is
uh like may proceed or uh more likely
will proceed in parallel with another
form of uh of civil war which one might
refer to as balkcanization or maybe in a
more British con context of
olsterization.
Um, it's a little awkward to use that
term because it specifically refers to
police changes uh in Olter, but uh in
this case I use it to kind of um uh
point a spotlight at the local uh the
local factionaliz factionalization
uh which uh which occurred
uh and in this essentially intertribal
uh conflict between fundamentally
between natives and non-natives although
there will be fracturing within both uh
those uh c categories. So the first
dirty war is basically elite
postnational elite versus uh
the street the blob versus the street.
Okay, put it that way or the we want our
country back versus why like or you know
you get it. So dirty war is is uh
essentially within
uh within uh the state and directed
primarily at punishing the power elite
for having
done what it has done. The intertribal
cont conflict is is much larger and and
will be much
more uh much more strenuous but also
largely I think conducted by
paramilitaries. It's not going to it's
not going to metastasize
into an Americanstyle mid-19th century
American civil war uh for lots of
completely obvious reasons. One of which
uh you you just mentioned with reflect
to respect to the availability of arms
and but a more important reason is that
there's no need for that. Um if you play
if you play it out um essentially with
through I think through primarily
through infrastructural attack
um combined with
essentially terroristic uh means you can
drive a kind of assortative movement
within society. So people people flee
from um mixed areas to less mixed areas
which is why I pointed I directed people
to look perhaps at the Balkans in the
early 1990s because that's exactly what
had happened. Uh so you get this period
of assorted movement in which these uh
groups essentially uh until what finally
emerges is essentially a series of zones
uh of fundamentally three types. uh zone
A would be uh uh the first zone being
areas where the non-native population is
concentrated and and sufficiently dense
uh and of a scale that it can physically
control that uh that territory
effectively produce what is some kind
sometimes called a no-go zone or a in
Mauist terms a stable a stable base uh
but or uh you might say an ethnic
enclave. But fundamentally what we're
referring to is a pe piece of mappable,
measurable physical terrain where uh the
the the uh uh a specific community is
able to physically control uh physically
control it. The zone A regions, these
are pretty easy to map out. Like in in
the case of the UK, I would think if you
start with the Humber at the Humber
River and you look northward going east
through west, there's a strip across the
middle of the country where you'll get a
a series of zone A probably not join not
joined up but a concentration of them.
Another zone uh would be essentially the
zone in which there is not much native
non-native population left because you
have had a period of assortative
movement. the difference uh the
difference there in in character if you
just look from a from a geographic and
from a if you look at a geographic and
demographic uh map of the country you
can see that that's uh some of the some
parts of some of the cities most of the
medium and smaller uh urban areas and
essentially all of the rural space.
That's important because uh in in in
terms of operations and tactics that's a
contiguous area. Those places are all
joined up whereas the first zone are are
basically islands.
There will be a third type of zone which
will not be terribly relevant and that
is the the very diminished zone in which
the state existing state authorities are
ma able to maintain uh
uh a degree of normal inverted commas uh
civil life. In the case of the UK, I
think that's basically going to be some
parts of metropolitan London inside the
M25 where they will have the power and
perhaps some parts of the other big
cities. Uh but
beyond that, I think that the that that
the state will uh the state potential is
um
pretty diminished. Um so that then if
you think of this map of a continuous ai
one contiguous zone with uh islands of
non-onti contiguous uh um uh non-native
dominated zones then it's reasonable to
expect just from a even a superficial
understanding of military history that
siege comes back. Uh that's
traditionally how you deal with uh with
a contested urban space. You don't go
into it. You lay siege to it. In modern
terms, how do you lay siege to uh an
area? You would do it by affecting by
attacking the the life support system.
Where are the life support systems of
contemporary cities located? outside of
the cities. Uh if take for example you
uh the city of Bradford for example uh
medium medium-sized UK city located uh
in the north
uh one of the kind of hot hot beds now
uh for uh these issues. Um,
how many petrol stations do you need to
do you need to destroy uh to make uh
fuel supply to basically turn Bradford
into a pedestrianized city because you
can't get the answer is is very low.
It's probably about 25 you could do. So
one could map it out. Um okay so that I
think is a conflict which is going to be
fought largely subrosa by paramilitaries
with the state trying to maintain a
certain amount of of control but
ultimately over time having to bend to
uh um
the the larger uh the larger zone.
>> Professor Bess, thank you very much. Um,
I'm just going to cut this bit out and
saying, but we're just going to have to
end the filming bit now. We can continue
talking for another 20 minutes, half an
hour, I think. Uh, but, uh, sort of
edited out saying that you do.
Professor, thank you very much for
joining us here at the Danube Institute.
>> Thank you.
