Hi how are you long time no see uh and today's topic is is ancient
0:33
Grace and to start ancient Grace is one of those very historically important
0:41
topics that our age doesn't talk about where I was having a conversation with a friend yesterday where we were talking
0:47
about how in our grandparents time when you started going to school you were
0:52
taught Plato and Aristotle that was just the foundation of education and we were saying how the fact that we were never
0:59
taught Plato Aristotle it set us back to intellectual levels where as a species
1:05
intellectually culturally militarily politically and much of our society
1:11
comes from ancient Greece and this is something our ancestors knew where for
1:17
the Western tradition they prized what the Greeks talked about and so they
1:23
found that the Greeks were able to just build up this beautiful found
1:29
found of a civilization and from that they would read authors like Plato or
1:34
Aristotle or all these ancient Greek thinkers and if you read histories from
1:40
the 19th century they are just completely gushing from about Greece if you read authors from like let's say
1:48
Edward Gibbon until which is Edward Gibbon was writing at the time of the American Revolution until uh World War
1:55
II it was widely held up that the Greeks were the most impressive nation that had
2:01
ever existed in history and so let's get into ancient Greece let's do it we are going to cover the time period from the
2:09
ancient Dark Ages until Alexander the Great and so we are this video is
2:14
ancient Greece not the ancient Greeks because the period we're talking about was when the Greeks were still in gree
2:21
and so after this Alexander the Great conquers the entirety of the Middle East out to India and then it the events of
2:30
what Greeks were doing became largely more so in the Middle Eastern North Africa or through indirect influence
2:37
through Rome and Greece has an interesting geography
2:43
and I've heard some historians say that Greece has a geography that parallels
2:49
Europe you look at Europe as a continent it's all these peninsulas it's surrounded by ocean all these islands
2:55
Jagged geography and Greece is like that too where Greece is just if you vomit on
3:01
the map it looks like Greece where it's all these Jagged Mountains and peninsulas and and that stuff and
3:07
there's theories that this created a social structure that was similar between the Greeks and the Europeans and
3:14
I think people overestimate our cultural similarity with the Greeks but there is definitely a a thread of Western
3:22
civilization and at the previous Bronze Age World
3:29
Greece was a peripheral player um and in the Bronze Age world this is like 2000
3:35
BC to uh 1200 BC and Eric Klein got a really interesting book about the Bronze
3:41
Age collapse and the Bronze Age collapse was this time period where every major
3:46
country of the Middle Eastern World system because the Middle East was the most important place in the world in this time period shattered in a single
3:53
generation so you have uh the hites in Turkey you have the Syrian King
4:00
Elum in Western Iran and they were all wiped out except for Babylon and Egypt
4:09
and Greece was a kingdom called the means and the uh the hites because we
4:15
have records of the hites and the Greeks talking to each other the hites were an Indo-European people in Turkey they were
4:21
possibly the greatest power of that time where the Meenan Greeks they were called
4:27
anaia by the Turks um and they were at War and so Greece and the hites were at
4:34
war in the Bronze Age world and the Meenan Greeks or the PE the the
4:42
Greece was unified under the Meenan Kingdom before the Bronze Age Dark Age
4:47
and it was a very aristocratic a very top- down Society where we found the uh
4:54
the ruins of the capital myi and it's very wealthy Cal
5:00
organized and it was this very Warrior tribal Society because both the
5:06
ancestors of the Myans and the uh hites
5:11
they were Arians and the Arians were this people from Modern Ukraine who had
5:17
settled this whole area from Ireland to India actually this it would be a dope
5:24
video if the next one was on the Indo-European or Arian invasions that would really be a dope next video but
5:30
the um they conquered the local peoples and for South Europeans they're about
5:35
2/3 to 3/4 uh Arian genetics and 2/3 local population they installed
5:42
themselves as a new ruling class and for the entire Greek period And this is a thread n pulls on a lot the Greeks have
5:48
this Warrior aristocratic culture and it it's counterbalanced with the later rationality and uh skepticism but if you
5:56
could find a single word to summarize the ancient Greek character you would say aristocratic it's a very Noble
6:03
aristocratic society and that permeates across their entire social structure where for example the Greeks they had
6:11
logic they invented early versions of the computer and they invented they had
6:16
these like cogs that would move around it's technically a computer and they used it to predict astrological signs
6:22
and they invented the steam engine too and they also had fertilizer but the reason they didn't use fertilizer the
6:28
steam engine or a computer is because using your understanding to change the
6:34
world was ungentlemanly because the gentlemanly thing to do was to just be
6:40
completely in your head and not have to toil on the physical world because that was what peasants do and so this sense
6:46
of nobility and it also permeates into Greek philosophy or it permeates into uh
6:54
it or it permeates into philosophy it permeates into their ideas of citizenship
7:00
because um because the Greek concept of
7:05
democracy came from this Aran War band system where Whoever has Force has power
7:12
and so democracies come from war band cultures uh because if everyone fights
7:17
everyone gets a vote and also the rationalistic tradition also came from the Arian Noble Heritage and it's
7:24
interesting I've read a lot of books that compare India to Greece and so you see parallels between Indian
7:30
civilization and Greek civilization where it's this same scientific inquisitive mind but for the Greeks it
7:36
went into philosophy and rationalism and for India it went into religion and so
7:43
the Greeks had that culture and that sort of social root and they conquered
7:49
the local people this is around I'd say 2500 BC and the previous inhabitants of Greece were the or the M the
7:56
Minoans and the manans are are are relative famous for ruling an area the
8:01
size of New Jersey where cre south of Greece it's this island pretty small and
8:07
it was the first European civilization and it uh the we've picked up some stuff from
8:14
the mowans they had a really beautiful art system uh they the myth of the Minotaur is about them we think that
8:21
they had a democracy in some sense of Human Rights they also are the first people to have a European artistic style
8:28
um and the Minoans grew weak and then they were
8:33
conquered by the means who insured them and the Myan State like all the other
8:39
Bronze Age States was on kind of weak foundations and so when the uh sea
8:46
peoples who were this people from Modern Italy we think the sea peoples attacked
8:52
across the entire Mediterranean and they wiped out States in uh turkey in Greece
8:58
in Syria they became the Philistines later which is interesting where the Philistines in the Bible they were
9:04
ethnically Greek uh Goliath's grandfather could have fought at Troy and the Sea peoples they wiped out
9:12
government in Greece and Greece fell into a Dark Age and Greece lost the ability to have writing they lost cities
9:19
they lost uh centralized government it was a dark age in Greece comparable to the Dark Age that happened with the fall
9:26
of Rome that resulted in the rise of Western Civilization
9:31
and then what occurred is that it forced the Greeks to restructure their entire
9:37
society and the Greeks relearned writing from the Phoenicians where the Phoenicians were traitors in Lebanon and
9:43
so our alphabet which the Greeks invented the Greeks invented a version and the Latins and the Italians made our
9:50
alphabet but uh the Greek alphabet is based off Phoenician principles and
9:56
interestingly the structure of modern science came from astrology that the
10:01
Greeks learned from the Middle East the Babylonians used astrology and astrology even though it is subjective and kind of
10:07
silly it does require precision and a logical structure and so the first
10:13
progenitor to science was astrology and so with this Dark Age the Greeks were
10:18
forced to restart and a dark age is one of the best things that can ever happen to a society where it forces people to
10:25
figure the crap out again to figure out what's going wrong and
10:30
the uh out of the Greek Dark Age came a lot of interesting social formations and
10:36
it was this gradualistic process kind of similar to how Europe pulled out of its Dark Age with the Middle Ages and the
10:43
most interesting book on this topic and probably the best book on this topic is uh Fel de kulan is the ancient city and
10:52
the thesis of the book is that the entire Greek social structure was built off the war band where the Greeks would
10:58
fight with Spears and so you had these ranks called hoplight of guys with Spears and shields who were heavily
11:04
armored and in that system everyone had to fight together it democratized the society if you want to know a society's
11:11
political system look at its military structure and the Greeks were the best people in the world at foot soldiers or
11:17
infantry well they barely had archers or cavalry and with this came this shared
11:23
concept and the Greek social structure was built on the blood of the war bands you have a city like Athens or thieves
11:29
or Macedon and there's the shared ethnos or the shared tribe and everything is
11:35
built around the tribe and in the Greek religious system religion was passed on through blood and so you had to give
11:42
religious offerings to the gods of your ancestors and so family line went down
11:48
through blood and so it's why it was so difficult for the Greek city states to integrate each other where if Athens
11:54
conquered neighboring states they couldn't make them Athenians because the Athenian identity was fundamentally
11:59
driven off blood and it was a very religious Society uh but not religious
12:05
in the way that we understand where their religion was about like you would sacrifice a goat to Zeus and then Zeus
12:11
wouldn't hurt you um and inside that war
12:16
band was very high social trust and the Greeks had the highest social Trust of anyone in the world at that point where
12:23
inside the same city state people were pretty kind to each other they were pretty uh they the Greeks
12:29
the social Trust of the Greeks is what allowed them to do such incredible things in their history inside the city
12:35
state the Greeks had no concept of freedom and that's something where we
12:41
project a lot of our social structure onto the Greeks where we think they were Freedom loving and capitalist and that
12:47
stuff no uh Greece was a a collectivist clan Society where everything was done
12:53
through an interpersonal relationship let's say if you're a baker you uh you make bread for you have you pick a
13:01
wealthy Patron who protects you then you make bread for you make bread for him
13:07
for free and then he protects you or everything is built around your family and your extended relations and in Greek
13:14
cities the state was allowed to do anything because it's not really a state it's the shared Community the community
13:20
was allowed to take your stuff it was allowed to make you die in battle make
13:25
you attend certain events and all of the Greeks all of the Greeks city states had this kind of Nanny State very uh
13:32
interfering sense of against personal life it's a society with no concept of Freedom uh and like every pre-industrial
13:40
society there was no concept of privacy either and that is a good lead into the
13:46
different kinds of Greek societies because the Greeks were very diverse
13:52
inside the different types of social structures they had where the two
13:58
easiest and most popular polarities are Athens versus Sparta because Athens and Sparta are opposites where the Spartans
14:06
both Athens and Sparta actually fit into this very notf free Society even though they were democracies there was a
14:12
certain period of about a hundred years where almost every state in the Greek world was a
14:17
democracy even Sparta was a was partly a democracy where you would elect the king
14:23
what happens next is that the Spartans developed their society around
14:29
militarism because the Spartans were a small Elite around 10% of the population and they insured the local hellot
14:35
population where Sparta is in the south of Greece and all of these Greek states are super important but keep in mind
14:42
each Greek city state is roughly the size of like a county in where I grew up in Pennsylvania these very tiny areas
14:50
completely Chang the course of history and Sparta was this Warrior culture I just read this uh this thing on Twitter
14:56
where there was a span ritual where every 10 days young men would stand
15:02
outside naked and have other people look at them to see if their bodies were perfect and my comment is that sounds
15:07
gay as hell but that's against the point and in Sparta what happened was that at
15:12
age seven everyone was forced to leave their families and go into the
15:18
government sponsored military training so you spent your entire life from ages 7 to 20 doing military training and this
15:25
was a society where it was obsessed with strength where Spartans weren't allowed to have money or even live soft lives
15:34
you were in the military until you were past age 40 you were only allowed to regular you were only allowed to rarely
15:40
see your wife uh to sleep with her to produce kids and Sparta actually had the best treatment for women of any uh any
15:49
of the Greek society Spartan women were given legal near Independence well in Athens they treated women like the
15:55
Taliban does today and and Sparta it it created this like alpha male warrior
16:01
Society um and Sparta was a cohesive Society at the expense of enslaved and
16:07
surfing most of the population and Sparta is the Athens and Sparta are interesting as you see multiple threads
16:13
for them where the Nazis and the Communists in Plato were all basing the ideal Society upon Sparta any single
16:20
totalitarian government today probably sees Sparta as the society they want to have so Sparta at the expense of this
16:29
was a very uncreative very uh undynamic Society it was just stagnant and the
16:37
reason the Spartans and the Athenians went to war was that athens's social structure allowed creativity more easily
16:44
than Sparta did so Athens was Rising faster than Sparta and the Spartans didn't want to deal with it and so the
16:50
Duality the other side of this is Athens where Athens was a capitalist a uh
16:58
libertarian uh Market a capitalist libertarian
17:03
pluralist Society so Sparta did have a democracy it was a relatively managed
17:08
democracy though and uh there was a famous ancient quote where the Spartans and the Greeks took great pride in being
17:14
free as in they didn't have a king um and the Spartan said we are the freest people in the world and then the joke is
17:21
a nons Spartan said yeah you're so free you put yourselves in Chains because their social structure was that rigid um
17:28
and so they would elect two different Kings and the Greeks cared a lot about preventing tyrants from Raising rising
17:35
to power and Tyrant is actually a Greek word where these Greek States they would
17:41
be democracies the Democracy would fall apart a tyrant would show up and Tyrant was actually originally a positive word
17:48
where the Tyrant was like this nice guy who Rose to power and he would give the mob Authority uh in exchange for uh he'd
17:56
give the mob Authority in exchange for fixing the society then it becomes to democracy again uh it wasn't always that
18:03
nice even Athens had tyrants where the tyrants often became tyrannical and um
18:10
the and Greece went through this whole process where so Greece started out as
18:16
this uh Noble society and then the nobility lost power as the Spearman got more power and then it became Democratic
18:23
and uh there was this whole period of class Warfare and so for all of the ancient Greek cities stat for this whole
18:29
period there was a lot of war between the lower and the upper classes and if anything killed modern if anything
18:37
killed ancient Greece it's class Warfare where the you got to a certain point where the classes refused to cooperate
18:42
and so in Athens as an example the um the you had a wise man named Solon and
18:51
Solon developed a legal code for Athens in which the different tribes inside Athens had different legal rights and
18:58
then upper and the lower classes had different representation inside the Democracy so Athens established this
19:04
pluralistic system where there was constant debate and you had to debate different political positions and so
19:11
Athens became uh I I've seen analyses by why Athens had such a powerful cultural
19:18
flowering and it's a combination Athens was a capitalist Society where they
19:24
Athen the Greeks were huge Merchants the Greeks traded everything from uh Spain
19:30
to Ukraine and later on uh down to India but that they have to conquer the Middle East First and the so partly it trade
19:39
between a lot of locations uh and so the Greeks the Athenians knew a lot about the world in a way like say the Spartans
19:45
didn't and then most Athenians were not Athenians most people in Athens were
19:52
slaves where only about 15% of the population could vote in Athens because
19:58
women couldn't Athens treated women comparably to how uh the Taliban treats women today so
20:04
whenever you imagine pagura whenever you imagine PL and Aristotle and that stuff just assume there are no women involved
20:10
women weren't allowed to go to the marketplace or the Agora or any of those places during the Athenian Golden Age
20:16
and also most of the population were slaves if most people are slaves you don't have to uh you don't have to worry
20:26
about stuff like how to put bread on the table because slaves work for you and um
20:31
so uh trading system slaves um then you
20:37
have uh if Athens was having a brief Empire at that point we need to actually
20:42
the Persians need to fight the Greeks before we get to that and then um there was a democracy and so if you have a
20:48
democracy you have to debate positions and that's how philosophy started where
20:53
um where philosophy started because you had to debate different mental positions
21:02
for there to be a democracy and there was this social class called the sophists and sophists were intellectual
21:08
lawyers you would pay a sophist to argue any point you wanted and so they were
21:13
this social class that was known for corruption and basically being lawyers um and Greek law was very Advanced the
21:19
Greeks had rule of law when almost no other cultures did and I think that's a big reason the Greeks were so successful
21:25
because you can almost perfectly correlate rule of law with um with a
21:31
society's wealth and so you have the two sides of The Duality aens and Sparta and
21:36
we only think about Athens today and there were lots of other Greek States and something I'm going to throw out
21:42
here is that in the gree's Golden Age there were more Greeks living in
21:48
turkey and Italy than in Greece itself because the Greeks as Herodotus called
21:53
them were frogs around the pond where you had Greek colonies all around and the Greeks populated the Mediterranean
21:59
climate zone region where you can perfectly correlate Greek and Phoenician settlement based off regions that have a
22:06
Mediterranean climate you had Greek States in Spain in Italy in uh parts of
22:13
Ukraine the coast of turkey was all Greek um Greece itself and you had Greek
22:20
colonies in Libya as well so the Greeks were frogs around the pond and the Greek
22:25
cities the Greek States and um and Italy and in Turkey were wealthier than
22:31
the Greek States in Greece itself if you actually wanted to find the most important Greek city state for most of
22:38
Greece it would be Syracuse in Sicily in southern Italy um and Syracuse is where
22:43
Pythagoras came from Pythagoras is one of the most important early Greek philosophers and he ran a he ran a cult
22:51
he developed a lot of modern mathematics and he developed a cult that made killing animals and eating beans illegal
22:58
um and they had really complex ideas around the soul and modern leftism is based off Pythagorean philosophy um
23:06
and then you have a bunch of places in Greece itself and a lot of these places are forgotten and will Durant's book on
23:13
this topic is probably the best and will Durant goes through all these city states and reading it I'm like damn
23:20
there's this weird little city state in the middle of Greece that was doing cool stuff I had never heard of them but it's
23:26
nice that they were doing cool stuff and then as a the third option you have thieves where thieves was the biggest
23:32
Greek city state and population but thieves doesn't really fit on any of the axes where thieves um it I think it was
23:41
an oligarchy and Aristotle divided All Greek regimes into monarchy oligarchy
23:47
and democracy thieves I think was an oligarchy it was very wealthy but it was on a different track than Athens or
23:53
Sparta and what I want to show here is that like the Greeks had huge cultural diversity they did a variety of things
23:59
they were probably the most culturally diverse of the civilizations I know of because even in
24:05
India India is a huge place it's much bigger than Greece had more ethnicities more people the differences between the
24:11
if different Indian city states or different Chinese city states I don't think their social structure was as
24:16
different as between the different Greeks and the Greeks had all these differences but they were unified by
24:22
this shared religion in this shared sense of being Greek or elen or hel the Greeks call themselves Helen it's the
24:28
origin of the word helenic this religion was based around the worship of the Gods
24:34
in Mount Olympus and the the Greeks thought the gods lived in this area of northern Greece in this mountainous area
24:40
called Mount Olympus and the um Greek mythology was not a based on morals it
24:47
was the gods were stronger and you worship strong things in the ancient world God equals powerful so that's why
24:53
ancient societies thought a king could be a God because if a king is power equal to a god he de facto is a god um
25:00
and the Greek religion over this time period got weaker and one of the most important stories that's never told
25:06
about ancient Greece is that at the death of religion is what killed Greece
25:12
because over this time period the Greeks rationalized their society but as they analyzed and rationalized their society
25:19
they also killed it because the Greek culture the Greeks lost the ability to have Vitality or courage or those sorts
25:26
of things and it's funny the Babylonians or the Egyptians they lost their civilizations and they went into decline
25:32
for being too religious the Greeks did the opposite and so over time the Greeks
25:38
believed in their gods less and less the more rational they got and they tried to counter this with mystery religions and
25:44
this is one of the elements we don't we only talk about half of the Greeks we think the Greeks were inherently
25:49
rational and uh they were deeply uh Democratic and principled and uh
25:57
controlled and civilized the reality is the Greeks were also barbaric they were religious fundamentalists it was a dirty
26:04
Society it was based off slavery and for every historic time period what we think about that Society tends to be true but
26:11
the opposite that we don't think about also tends to be true and and so with
26:16
the Greeks religion is a huge thread and so the way the Greeks saw thinkers like
26:22
Plato and Aristotle and uh Pythagoras and uh more
26:29
is that they saw them as religious figures where they were prophets of the Hidden oric religion and orus was this
26:38
Prophet from thce and thce is a it's an ethnic Barbarian area in modern Bulgaria
26:45
and so the orix this Prophet taught these secret rituals that where he went into Hades into the underworld and then
26:52
he taught the secret rituals on how to find the uh find the Divine and the Dian
26:57
cult which supposedly came out of turkey the dianis cult which supposedly came out of Iran and taught the same thing
27:03
and so with these sorts of thing the Greeks were very rational in one part of their lives and they'd go crazy they'd
27:08
do drugs they dance themselves into hallucinations on the other side so you had these secret these secret societies
27:14
where you were not allowed to say what happened you would do these crazy rituals and the Greek
27:21
interpretation of Plato and Socrates and Pythagoras is they were prophets of the
27:27
orphic religion in their worldview those people were religious figures who went
27:33
into the spirit world and uncovered philosophic truths we've made them become seen as rational because we're in
27:39
a Christian Society where you're not allowed to look at the religious interpretations of those thinkers and um
27:46
over time though religion got weaker in ancient Greece and so Greece fell into degeneracy and then over time it was
27:53
gradually replaced by Christianity do you have any questions so far yes say more about how it how it went into
28:00
degeneracy yes so it's comparable to the modern West and
28:06
where as the West lost the shared value system given to it by Christianity you
28:12
lost the ability to either have cooperation across social classes not
28:17
rip people off um the ability to have the courage to fight or to have kids or
28:23
to believe in stuff and so Greece went through this process of nihilism
28:28
and um nihilism and degeneracy
28:34
that that is very comparable to our society where we have records of the
28:39
Greeks just losing the will to live and we're going to cover this in a future episode we make on
28:47
helenismo badly in the in the next Greek episode but um so you have records of
28:52
the ancient Greeks let the ancient Greeks would open their gates to let the Romans in to conquer them and you have
28:58
records of the Greeks not having children and the Greek Countryside being empty and you know a society is dead
29:05
when it lets when it invites Invaders to kill them and when it stops having kids and when it doesn't believe in God got
29:11
it that makes sense yeah it's funny like having done this show for you for a bunch of hours I realized there are very
29:18
common historic patterns we see all the time in these episodes and if you read history they're completely obvious but
29:23
to most people it would never occur to them and it's crazy that you can have dozens of examples of something happened
29:30
historically and we're still we're still uh weirded out by it and can't figure out the
29:35
pattern and like is there common so we get we see common patterns of degeneracy
29:41
or sort of like spiraling do we see it come back um or is it just like the Empire's fall and then the the historic
29:49
patterns for a new strong Society is that it's rural it believes in itself it
29:54
has a high birth rate it has a sense of religion um um it has a sense of
29:59
morality that TR transcends life that being honorable is more important than living um and it's willing to make
30:08
mistakes and so that's the pattern for societies On The Rise so if you see something with if you see a society also
30:14
their's social trust and and their sense of cultural Unity if you see a society with those traits assume it's going to
30:21
do very well in the future um and and so why R because this is something Spangler
30:29
Taps into where uh societies tend to form in Rural and then they blow up into
30:34
cities and then once they blow up into cities they can extend their growth further and then they calcify and they
30:42
lose creativity and then there's the Dark Age and I think it's probably do with rural societies are closer to what
30:49
humans evolved with and so uh it it and so it creates this sense of social trust
30:56
and rootedness to the Earth which allows creativity and then as your Society gets more urban you lose the ability to
31:05
interact with the world for what it is and you start interacting with people for you start it's like so you build the
31:12
institutions to fight nature and then once you've fought nature you build
31:17
institutions to manage human societies and then those become disconnected from nature and that's the thesis of a book I
31:24
have called the collapse of complex civilizations by tainter where he says what happens if you build up you fight
31:30
nature then you build up the system the system becomes so complicated that one part of it can break and then the system
31:39
breaks H God it makes sense yeah so to get back to Greece the um the first part
31:47
of Greek philosophy in the first Greek Golden Age the first Greek golden age was in modern Western turkey and as I
31:52
said before Western turkey was the wealthiest uh place in early Greece
31:57
where you have the Malaysian philosophers and the Malaysian philosophers invented the scientific hypothesis where they said that all of
32:04
existence is water and that might not mean what people think it does in
32:10
because from alchemical and hermetic philosophy water is constant fluidity so what they might be trying to say is that
32:16
the world is constantly mixing atoms and constantly breaking apart and flowing around I don't know they could have also
32:23
legitimately believed that the world is water and you have thinkers like democratus or thol that come out of the malians in the west
32:30
coast of turkey and turkey has been Greek for over 3,000 years and the Turks
32:36
only for the Western third of of turkey it was Greek until a hundred years ago and the Turks kicked them out and uh
32:43
genocided the local Greek population um and then the Western third of turkey
32:48
like uh there was a kingdom called Lydia and Lydia is where like midas's Golden
32:54
Touch he was the king of Lydia and Lydia was to the Greeks what Canadians are to
32:59
Americans they're culturally very close but they're technically different and
33:05
then what happened is that the Persians conquered Western turkey or as it was called then Anatolia people get super
33:12
triggered when I call this era of history when I call it turkey because the Turks only came later but at this
33:18
point there are certain things I say purposely to trigger people like I call the Netherlands Holland uh he just not a
33:24
meaningful difference and it triggers people um and and
33:30
so the Persians came out of the East and the Persians conquered the Greek settlements in Libya and in turkey and
33:38
uh in and in Northern uh Greece like the
33:43
area around thce and Macedonia and actually Alexander the
33:50
Great's family and the family that later conquered the Persians they were founded as the governors of the pers province of
33:58
Macedonia and the Persians are legitimately the most impressive Empire
34:04
in world history up to the Romans or the Chinese where the Persians ruled an area longer than the current United States in
34:10
size and this was 500 BC and certain authors say that a majority of the
34:16
world's population lived in the Persian Empire because this was the era where all like the Persians dominated almost
34:22
the entire urbanized world except India and China and Persia was a relatively
34:27
Humane Kingdom where the Persians were the nicest guys up to that point they respected culture Cyrus the Great the
34:34
founder of the Persian Empire he's he was written up for everyone as being the greatest ruler ever even Cyrus's enemies
34:41
like the Jews or the later Christian authors or the Greeks they would write up Cyrus as like he is legitimately the
34:47
greatest ruler ever so there were a lot of benefits to Persia but Persia still
34:52
was this Oriental despotism that crushed creativity and so people say if the
34:58
Persians conquered Greece would the Greeks still have had their Cultural Revolution and the short answer is no
35:03
because after the Persians conquered the west coast of Turkey um that they just
35:08
stopped creating new stuff um and Dan carin's got a wonderful podcast talking
35:15
about both Persia and the Persian Greek Wars and there's this funny story from Herodotus and Herodotus was the inventor
35:22
of modern history he was in Athens where the king of Lydia the Greek speaking state she went to the Oracle of dely and
35:29
the Oracle of dely was this Oracle that all of Greece shared and she would give
35:34
you advice and the Oracle of dely was originally a teenage girl and they were they were drinking they were smelling
35:40
fumes that caused mental intoxication and so the irony is that the Oracle of
35:46
dely was a politically biased organization and so it would give out predictions for the political biases of
35:52
the Oracle which is that's just too real like you think magical Oracle is God an
35:57
objective no um and so the Oracle was Pro Persian because the Persians bribed the Oracle to be a scop and so they kept
36:04
on giving Pro Persian advice to the Greeks um and um so the king of Lydia
36:11
asked the Oracle of Deli do I attack Persia and the Oracle said if you attack Persia a great Empire will fall his
36:19
empire fell um and so the Persians wanted to conquer Greece itself and they
36:25
actually allied with the carthaginians in North Africa to attack the Greeks in Italy too but um the Persians first went
36:33
after Athens because Athens was a state that had helped the greek-speaking rebels in Western turkey and so the
36:40
Persians sent a fleet out to conquer Athens and it's funny I've read a lot of
36:45
military histories and they frequently call the Athenian generals move against
36:51
the Athens genius but when the Persians landed and they were still preparing to fight the Athenian general just said
36:56
attack now and so he attacked the Persians before they were ready and destroyed them it's called the Battle of Marathon and I've read enough military
37:04
history to realize that something profoundly Simply Stupid at the right time can be genius just attack at the
37:10
right time is genius uh and so this humiliated the Persians and because the
37:16
Persians had never lost and they lost to a city state the size of Delaware and that was humiliating and so the Persian
37:23
uh Emperor I was going to say Zar the Persian Emperor Xerxes he had a
37:29
slave or this is the Herodotus account history is strange though history is strange enough that this could be true
37:36
uh Xerxes asked his slave every single day before dinner tell me that remind me
37:42
that Athens must be destroyed so the Athenians clearly did piss off an emperor a continental sized Emperor and
37:49
so they built up another Army and I don't really trust the Greek sources the Greek sources say that the Persians had
37:54
an army of a million men and they would drink Rivers dry and um we think the
37:59
real number is more like 300,000 and the Persians amassed this Army and theyd to
38:05
attack Greece by land and so they walked over turkey walked over Macedonia then
38:10
down into Greece and so the Greeks formed this Coalition of all these states together and in real situations
38:17
like this you determine who is fake and who is cool where the cool Greeks banded together to fight off the Persians and
38:24
there were lame Greeks who helped the Persians and the cool Greek Confederacy included Athens and Sparta and uh I
38:32
think thieves went with the Persians and so this is where the story of 300 comes in where there were actually about uh
38:41
1,200 men who were guarding this mountain pass called thermop where thermop is between the mountains and the
38:47
Sea so it's this tiny area and the Spartans had these amazing infantry and so these 1,200 Spartans could hold off
38:54
an army of 300,000 Persians for a week because the Persians could only filter through this tiny area where the
39:00
Spartans could use their better soldiers and then um a local farmer taught the
39:05
Persians how to go around the mountain to kill the the Spartans but in the meantime thermop is one of the most
39:10
heroic battles ever and it bought time for the Athenians and the GRE and the Spartans to start building up their
39:16
military and so the Persians went down Greece they sacked uh Athens and burned
39:22
Athens to the ground well the Athenians moved their entire population
39:27
onto a neighboring Island uh because Athens was a naval society and so the
39:33
Athenian leader asked the Oracle of Deli how do we protect Athens from the
39:38
Persians and they said make walls of wood and he interpreted that as build up a navy and that's what the Athenians did
39:45
and then the Athenians through clever tactics wiped out a Persian navy twice their size at the Battle of Salamis
39:52
where they rammed the Persians into again a into a naval small Channel and then killed them and so with the the
39:59
complete destruction of the Persian navy that was manned by Phoenicians and other Greeks the Persians couldn't Supply
40:06
their army and so the Persians had to send back most of their army to uh back
40:11
to the Empire well they had a smaller Army that was left in Greece and so the Spartans developed an army and brought
40:18
out an army from their Peninsula and then wiped out the Persians at the Battle of platea and thus with the
40:24
second p with the second uh Greco Persian War War the Greeks were able to
40:29
wipe out a Persian army that outnumbered them by some ridiculous margin something
40:34
like 4:1 and so this created this sense of profound pride and just happiness
40:40
among the Greeks that they fought off this giant Empire and they were able to do it so gloriously and so after this
40:47
came this period of profound optimism in Greece where um
40:53
where they just they did all this really cool stuff and this is is golden age
40:58
because in the process of fighting off the Persians the Athenians built up this colonial Empire across the aan which
41:05
included all these islands and peninsulas and the west coast of turkey at some point and so the Athenians used
41:13
their empire and they put it into the great golden age and uh I've read histories of ancient Greece that are 600
41:20
pages and 400 are just on Athens in that time period That's how much the
41:25
Athenians made this cultural expl and if you want to know more the philosophy watch the axial age video
41:31
we've released but the Athenians invented modern they they they did so
41:36
much in modern they invented modern philosophy theater a lot of architecture the field of History uh so many things
41:45
were invented in Athens by a citizen population of like 15,000 guys uh over a
41:52
generation it's just absolutely incredible to watch and the Athenians made such a Quantum Leap Forward that
41:58
you just stare at it and you think how the hell did you guys do that and uh it
42:04
it's like uh so many of our assumptions between when you go back to see how much the Greeks have done you realize that
42:10
our concept of logic is Greek our concept of um of how we see ourselves in
42:16
the world our history writing uh our concept of how to write a a plot for a
42:21
story it all stems from the Greeks and I don't know what we would have done without the Greeks where would have
42:27
taken a completely different direction and so it's intensely impressive and um
42:33
and at the same time though this Athenian Golden Age was very brief where
42:39
it was it was built on this piece that was pretty transient between the Persian
42:46
Wars and the wars between the Spartans and the Athenians do you have any questions um no I just trying to okay
42:53
keep everything good for now yeah yeah so the who was uh the Athenian Commander at a
43:00
certain point he wrote one of the best histories ever where Herodotus was the first historian and then thiddies was
43:07
the uh he wrote the most compelling history and thiddies has all this stuff like Concepts that historians today
43:14
still struggle with like motivation or concept of time or like the character
43:19
and theid hits a lot of very advanced concepts and facities said that the pelian wars between the the SP spans and
43:27
the Persians occurred due to uh Athens was Rising faster than
43:34
Sparta where Sparta was the traditionally stronger player and then what happened is that as Athens was
43:40
growing faster Sparta felt it had to attack Athens where Athens got stronger
43:46
and this is something called faid's trap it's applied recently to us Chinese relations where the US has or the US has
43:53
to start a war with China before China goes grows stronger than us and you can apply the ced's trap to World War I and
44:00
a bunch of other conflicts and so Athens and Sparta had a war in our Convention
44:07
of history is that we view the Athenians As Nice Guys and the Spartans as barbarians But the irony is that the
44:12
Athenians were hated by their empire they were seen as preening arrogant entitled preachy while the Spartans were
44:19
isolationist so they were loved by their empire and so it's interesting that the Spartans held together their Coalition
44:25
more easily than the Athen did where you had the Delian League and you had the uh
44:31
you had the you had the Athenian league and then you had the pelian league and the pipian War lasted for a really long
44:39
time it lasted for over a generation and it just bled Greece White and the pelian
44:44
war is to Greece what the world wars were to Europe where Europe before the world wars all this cultural
44:50
technological economic military social creativity Europe got nuked by the world wars and
44:57
then what happened is that the same thing occurred to Greece and the pelian wars was the unraveling of the Greek
45:04
golden age and the Greeks had another golden age called the helenistic period That's a completely different context
45:10
and over the pelian wars Greece had a version of the Black Death that killed a
45:15
third of the population and the Greeks stopped being democracies because they stopped having the the foot soldiers and
45:23
the hop plights where it was a democracy when every guy fought but after a generation of warfare normal people
45:30
couldn't fight because all the young men were dead so you started hiring mercenaries and professional armies and
45:35
when the government has professional armies this is why the founding fathers didn't trust professional armies by the way the government has the power not the
45:42
men and so Athens sto being Athens gradually degraded into corruption and a
45:49
lot of Plato's criticism of democracy came from seeing how corrupt Athens
45:55
became and uh then after a generation of
46:01
warfare Athens gradually got worn down more so than Sparta and I this wasn't a
46:06
war that was especially uh predetermined Athens could have won the war but Athens
46:11
sent its entire the pride of its manhood uh out to Sicily and Syracuse in the
46:18
Greek city state there and Syracuse was one of the few states in the Greek world that would that could rival Athens in
46:24
power and because the the the the syracusan they had made some overtures
46:31
to the Spartans and Pericles who was the greatest ath Athenian leader he was much
46:36
like bismar the German leader before World War I where he said don't fight the Spartans be careful with how we
46:42
spend men and uh all that sort of thing and the next leader alabes and alabes
46:49
was a weird dude he was super charismatic he was this Athenian Statesman he betrayed Athens then he
46:54
fled to the Greeks then he betrayed the Greeks then he fled the Athens you should read the Wikipedia entry on
46:59
alabes um and there was this incredibly aggressive arrogant idea of let's just
47:05
conquer Sicily but then the Athenian expedition to Sicily was so poorly LED
47:10
that the entire Athenian Army got wiped out and so that's what turned to tide of the war and then at the end the Spartans
47:17
were able to beat Athens and then this led Greece to become more oligarchic
47:23
less capitalist um and less philosophical where the Spartans turned
47:28
Athens into a client state of theirs and the Persians that been playing this game the whole time where the Persians
47:34
realized it wasn't in their self-interest to conquer Greece they should just fund the Greeks killing each other so the Persians kept on paying the
47:40
Greeks to kill each other until Greek society went into a decline and thus the
47:48
um the pelian wars just bled Greece White and the Greeks lost the will to
47:53
fight because so many of their men had died and they lost optimism and so Sparta had also been so weakened they
48:00
couldn't afford to really um they couldn't afford to really uh keep Greece
48:05
running and so thieves which is a state to the north they had had their own period where they briefly dominated
48:12
Greece and a lot of this is based off uh military Styles where the Athenians had
48:19
the best infantry but then these thians started using archers and Horsemen and
48:24
then with archers and Horsemen they could wipe out entire Spartan Army at the Battle of lucra which was traumatic
48:30
because the Spartans their whole thing was the military so if they lose the military they lose everything and um
48:38
over time as well the Spartans became degenerates and um they stopped being so
48:43
manly they started having inequality they stopped having children so that's a
48:49
sign that even the most masculine Chadley Society does fall into degeneracy because if the Spartans go
48:55
degenerate everyone goes degenerate and the feans were never really able to
49:00
cement their Authority until Macedonia came down and Macedonia is this uh was
49:06
this Barbarian State culturally related to the Greeks in modern uh Macedonia and
49:13
North Greece um and the macedonians were a big state they conquered modern
49:19
Bulgaria and that whole region they were the biggest state in Greece another example of the outsider strategy winning
49:26
where conquer conquer barbarians then turn back and conquer the Civilized world
49:31
and the macedonians had the greatest Greek philosopher and the greatest Greek king where Philip of
49:38
Macedon unified the Barbarian tribes and the macedonians made such good soldiers
49:44
because they as a barbarian people they still had the will to fight while the Greeks didn't and so he standardized
49:51
these Barbarian peoples and there was more social Mobility among the macedonians than among the other Greeks
49:57
and he um Turned the Macedonian nobility into incredible shock Cavalry and so
50:02
Philip of Macedon was the greatest Statesman of Greek history and his son was Alexander the Great and he conquered
50:10
all of Greece and Greece was unified by a barbarian people where the macedonians
50:16
were half barbar Barbarian half civilized and he gradually consumed the
50:22
Greek city states and by the end it was just pathetic where the Greek city states they were Quant constantly
50:27
squabbling they couldn't get anything done they were depressed uh and so
50:33
Macedonia unified the Greeks and then with that was able to use the Vigor of the Greeks to conquer the entirety of
50:40
the Middle East and the known world because Philip of Macedon was the greatest ruler up to that point in
50:46
history uh in Greek history but his son was so much greater that it makes Philip
50:52
of Macedon look weak um and so this opens up to the next chapter of Greek
50:57
history that being Hellenism when the Greeks had their giant colonial empires in the Middle East and North Africa the
51:05
um and should we get into that or should we uh no that's that's another episode that that's another 300 years we covered
51:12
like uh we covered like 500 years in this episode most of it was in the Greek Dark Ages or but no we covered 1200 BC
51:20
to uh 350 BC so that's 900 years but most of it we gloss over the Dark Ages
51:27
there's another 300 years of helenismo Aristotle is an interesting
51:32
thing here where Aristotle was a Macedonian who moved down to Athens and Aristotle was the end of Greek
51:39
philosophic creativity where um Socrates
51:44
knew Aristotle no Socrates knew Plato and Plato was a student of Socrates and
51:50
then Aristotle was a student of Plato So these three guys who were friends created Western philosophy and if you
51:55
want to know more watch the video on the axial age but um after Aristotle the
52:01
Greeks stopped being creative where uh or they the Greeks became creative technologically and religiously but not
52:07
philosophically where the um where Socrates invented the idea of
52:13
of using rational questioning Plato invented the concept of philosophy and Plato was more of a Mystic than anything
52:19
else he invented the concept of a spiritual realm of ideas and then Aristotle created intellectual
52:25
codification where Aristotle Aristotle was the guy who wrote the book on everything he wrote the book on rhetoric
52:31
on Politics on ethics on um on uh
52:36
anything you could possibly imagine but Aristotle's attempt to categorize the world was the attempt to simplify the
52:42
world and make it more useful for people and so that kind of signaled the weakening of Greek creativity and after
52:49
Aristotle it kind of shows that you weren't allowed to not you weren't allowed to criticize aist for the next
52:55
2,000 years until the invention of Science in the 1600s Aristotle just had
53:00
the correct opinion on medicine or ethics or that stuff and it signifies
53:06
that um the Greeks had spent their creativity but they were willing to do stuff afterwards and it sign also
53:13
signifies that there wasn't a period of equal philosophic creativity to the Greeks until the modern world until the
53:21
modern West which is a stunning compliment to the Greeks and of itself that they set a parallel that the rest
53:27
of History was that was that willing to to to follow yeah that that makes sense is
53:34
there anything before rapping that we didn't yet get to get to before getting to the the books like you know a lot of
53:41
people talk about this topic you you looted to it a little bit but is um what do you think are the greatest misunderstandings or things that are
53:47
underappreciated about this era you're going to ask me about Bron age pervert um I haven't read his book yet his
53:54
thesis sounds plausible the idea that the nobility mixing to create Eugenics that made philosophy I would need to
54:00
read his book to actually get uh to actually get his argument as far as I
54:06
understand it I don't have any argument against it but I'd have to see the evidence where the Greeks did have
54:11
Eugenics where um like in Sparta uh if there was a strapping young
54:18
man or like a Chad the Chad had the legal right to sleep with any woman who agreed to because his genetics were so
54:23
good that's how their society worked and so they would also let out if you didn't like a baby you were just allowed to let
54:29
it die um it was abortion after birth so the Greeks were anti Eugenics um so
54:35
that's the far right perspective on it um the left hasn't really like the left
54:41
doesn't think on ancient history anymore um and the misconception I see the most with the ancient Greeks is that we Gass
54:47
them up a lot and I compare it to the Middle Ages where yes the Greeks deserve to be gassed up they're one of the most
54:53
admirable peoples and most creative peoples ever but but the Greeks were also like a slave state it was a pretty
54:59
dirty Society we imagine ancient Greece to be this like uh we imagine to be this
55:05
pure rational philosophic Society but in reality it was violent dirty sexual
55:11
religious all like slavery all that stuff um and that we see the Greeks as
55:18
being part of western civilization but I don't think that's true I think Western Civilization is a creation of the Middle
55:24
Ages where Greece it was a collectivist clan Society it
55:29
had no concept of Freedom it had no concept of Morality In a Christian sense
55:34
it had uh it didn't have it had a capitalism it didn't have modern capitalism uh it didn't have our legal
55:40
system like almost all of the West's modern institutions stem from the Middle Ages
55:46
where our democracy comes from medieval parliaments and we we attribute modern democracy to the Greeks and yes our
55:53
founding fathers uh got a lot of their ideas from the Greeks but the modern
55:59
like Congress comes from Parliament and so we attribute more similarity to the Greeks than it really deserves and um
56:07
and an interesting story here is that Greece after uh after it fell and after
56:15
Alexander the Great went through its Latin American period where Greece the Greek city states were constantly being
56:22
attacked by the they constantly had military dictatorships and hunas and uh
56:28
Power Politics as they couldn't maintain stability and the interesting thing is Greece had socialism it had feminism
56:35
which is something you don't think about and the reason founding fathers upon making the American Republic knew that
56:40
we would end up with socialism and wealth redistribution is that they looked to the Greek parallel and they
56:46
saw that that was The Natural end point of like a dozen different Greek democracies and they had the wisdom that
56:52
we don't have today and the so there's a
56:57
great story about Greek communism and Greek feminism where for the Communist there this uh Greek play where someone
57:06
where there were and this is a comedy where they asked a Greek communist so everyone is no one's going to work
57:13
there's going to be no everything's going to be held in common no private property so who does the work and the Greek communist communist says the
57:19
slaves of course and that was an actual principle of Greek communism that of
57:25
course you would always have slavery but everything shared among the citizen class so Greece kind of fell apart due
57:31
to these very warped class politics where they had because Greek capitalism
57:36
died and Greece grew poor because the Socialists overregulation
57:56
the Athenians treated women like the Taliban treats women today but over the next Century Greece started having
58:03
feminism where women got legal equality with men over the next century and then
58:09
there was a Greek play by Aristophanes which talked about a society where only women voted and in that Society it would
58:16
be communist there would be sexual communism where to sleep with an attractive girl you'd have to sleep with
58:21
an ugly girl first you remove the nuclear family there's no privacy and also the Greek Council women
58:29
complain about how hard it is to be a senator while being senators and how cold the Senate is and um they can't
58:36
develop a coherent strategy so some parts of human nature stay um and and so
58:43
you can draw a lot of parallels between our current society and the Greeks and the Greeks at a level of wisdom that
58:48
we're missing today sexual communism that's a that's a new one yeah exactly um I've heard
58:55
racial communism but I didn't know it was a sexual communis I mean sexual communism exists today it's why we have
59:00
like body positivity
59:06
exactly exactly yeah exactly uh any any final questions no no uh should we uh
59:13
wrap on that yeah let me drop some books too um so the best book on this topic is
59:19
Fel the kulan is the ancient city I'm saying that because my background's in anthropology so that but that's the
59:25
anthropology book The Life of Grace by Will Durant this is very good although he does have Athens derangement syndrome
59:33
um I have heard that this is one of the best I've heard this is one of the best books in the Greeks uh sailing the wine
59:38
dark Sea by Cahill um rise of the west by McNeil is just
59:45
like holistically the best book on any given topic uh and the classical Worlds
59:50
by uh Robin Lane Fox I have not read this but it looks very good so those are
59:56
my books amazing uh okay always a always a pleasure and excited for the for the
1:00:02
next episode yes next episode is the Indo Arian invasions awesome excellent
1:00:07
okay sounds good peace man bye take care
