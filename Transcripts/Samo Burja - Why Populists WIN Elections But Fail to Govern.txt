Welcome To Live players where political
scientists and strategists Sam o bua and
I discuss the key individuals with the
power to alter our current Society every
week we provide analysis of the news and
case studies of Live players as well as
key institutions and technologies that
make up the global power landscape let's
dive
in hello oh hey Eric hey Sam how you
doing pretty good let's talk about the
challenges and the strengths and
limitations of populism as a political
strategy yeah let's get into it you know
it's fascinating there's this famous
Steve Bannon interview where he's in
Oxford talking to students at the PBS
interview and they're saying hey Trump
is this you know the end of democracy
and he's saying the end of democracy
there are more people voting than ever
before and they say oh democracy isn't
just people voting he's saying oh I'm a
simple guy think democracy I think
people voting but you know it just goes
to this idea of like you know democracy
is when people vote for the candidate
who people want to win populism is when
you know people vote for the candidate
that that you don't want to win but it
seems like what Ben was also talking
about is what happened in the US is is
kind of happening all throughout Europe
and and other plac in the world which is
sort of the rise of this you know
populist movement and he he's been
trying to stoke it so why don't you give
some context for this and and let's
unpack further what's actually happened
here what's happening well you know it's
it's my wonderful ful democracy versus
your corrupt populism obviously and
that's always the standard right and I
think that the right also had its own
critique of certain very popular
movements that happened in let's say the
third world so here's perhaps the
surprising Point here when when Hugo
Chavez ascended to power for the
political context of his country he was
kind of a populist he was sort of
proposing hey let's increase living
standards let's do things differently
internationally let's commune with
Simone Bolivar you know actually I'm
leaving a seat open for Simone bolar at
every presidential meeting and that
sounds like you know mildly insane it's
like is does he think he's communing
with the dead no he's just sort of
appealing to this kind of like concrete
National mythology that the country in
question has and I think a factor that
underlines populism
that
is I think basically sort of universal
is this appeal to popular sentiment now
popular sentiment can be right or it can
be wrong I I happen to think that a lot
of popular sentiment on questions like
free speech or the challenges of how to
process immigration I think it's correct
but in the case of Venezuela it was not
correct in terms of what to do with the
extremely functioning extremely well
functioning before or take over oil
company and I think that the view there
is that you acquire power or popular
mandate through basically popular
support So populism is democratic power
most directly understood and it has been
a strategy that we have seen throughout
political history we' started talking
about it in the last decade or so but if
you look at basically any historical
Republic you could have the optimists
and the populars right as you had in the
Roman Republic and you could have your
own version of say 19th century version
of say the culture war and so
on what is perhaps different though is
that I think the last time populism was
truly used when the popular mandate was
the basis of political reform the sort
of opponent of populism was just
basically feudalism or almost monarchy
if you look at 1848 in Europe or even
you know
1776 in the United States the popular
mandate legitimates a break with the
previous establishment and its
replacement and say in the American case
it's not quite a rebellion against
feudalism I think it's more sort of like
a a breaking from from a a kind of
mercantilist Republic a merchant
Republic crowned one but still and
creation of a new
Republic and I think in the European
case of 1848 with the Revolutions in
Germany France Etc there's more
straightforward the the toppling of
feudalism and I think what's different
is that for the first time ever
democracy is fighting the 20th century
administrative bureaucratic
State people do not understand how
extensive and
expansive modern states are if you
compare the United States today versus
1900 you know you could sort of fund a
1900 sized State through tariffs and you
didn't even need an income tax there was
no income tax actually you cannot fund
uh a state that's sort of half of GDP in
that way though of course there are you
know people who float an idea of a
return to that I think I think Donald
Trump's been playing around with with
that idea or at least mentioning it in
the US context so the balance of power
is profoundly different from when
democracy or a Democratic Force reshaped
politics last so the balance of power
politically in an 18th century state in
an American Colonial context is already
different from a 19th century fragmented
small European state that started
industrializing like a place like
Bavaria for example right or a place
even like you know in a way France which
is a bit bigger and that's very
different from a place where the
administrative State already exists now
the interesting part of this is that
arguably populism is sort of what
created the administrative state in the
first place rather wrote the political
check that allowed the state to exist
you know there's this whole forgotten
period of early 20th century American
politics where you know you have
politicians like Huey Long I think it's
like probably decently correct to
describe Huey Long as a populist right
he was the governor of Louisiana from
1928 to
1932 and then he was a senator for
another three years he basically
assembled with popular mandate a full-on
political
machine and this was D driven with a
kind of redistributionist agenda and at
the end of the day FDR's America while
it had significant elitist elements was
also populist in the most
straightforward sense of like promising
people things that they wanted right
basically it was supposed to alleviate
the aftermath of the Great
Depression once the administrative state
was assembled there was this long
history of sort of tweaking it from like
the
1940s all the way to the present era you
could consider it sort of like a a
seamless transition from the Cold War
era to the post to the post
1990s neoliberal fully globalized era so
you have like the cold war period where
it's basically the military industrial
complex on steroids complex game of
international diplomacy and then post
1990s it's sort of this attempt to
basically allow enough economic growth
to fund the massive states that have
come into existence right so I I think
for a while in the 1990s that seemed to
kind of work even in places like Britain
that have since fallen off it seemed
like economic growth would be fast
enough that the ever increasing spending
would be balanced but this seems less
and less likely over time So eventually
I think Europe will have to basically
abandon the kind of Social Democratic
model but the Social Democratic model is
just a variant of the administrative
State like I said the sort of National
Security State the like hyper
bureaucratized hyper regulatory agency
of Washington DC have in a deep
philosophical sense a closer similarity
to Brussels than they do to 19th century
American governance and I think that
sort of brings us to the Paradox the
national myths of not just the United
States but all liberal
democracies were made in a time before
there was a bureaucratic entrenched
establishment and now there has been one
for 80 years so will the same tactics
actually work against it unclear it's
clear it can win elections right
arguably politically let me give an
example of a cultural win and maybe a
political
win where I think that say Victor Orban
and Hungary has not managed to solve the
fundamental problems Hungary faces
hungary's economic growth is no better
than say Poland or other Eastern
European countries the migration is a
bit lower um they're interested in
expanding nuclear power but haven't done
so already yet at every level of
government the main conservative party
sort of has a profound bench of people
working in government so Hungarian
government is not smaller than say
polish government or Czech government
but it's staffed by cultural
conservatives so they tend to focus on
things that promote basically middle
class lifestyle even when we think of
something like the child subsidies there
are given in the form of like extra
loans for a car and like discounts on
baby car seats and tax breaks so very
much in a way aimed at developing not
just higher fertility but like just a a
middle class Society right that that
Hungarian conservatives that are
modestly promark
modestly socially conservative not even
that religious somewhat nationalist
would like so that's perhaps a cultural
win it's not a developmental win and it
involved the co-opting of the
administrative state by fedus slowly
painstakingly with orban's reforms they
have not yet succeeded at raising
fertility by the way despite that being
sort of the flagship policy they've
raised fertility a little but and a
every little bit helps but while
spending several percentages of GDP
they've not managed to get it above
replacement now arguably it's totally
worth it because 100% of GDP only exists
because people are there right 100% of
GDP is because of the humans who live
there but still so I would call that a
cultural win but then I'll give an
example of populist failure which was
successfully mobilizing against the
bureaucratic and political establishment
of vote for brexit in Britain and brexit
did happen but I don't think the outcome
is one the population is happy with and
I don't think Britain then charted a new
course there was no British Renaissance
after for a little bit it seemed like
there might be so we see here that like
merely meaning winning an election does
not automatically result in either
figuring out an alternate political
economy it might just result in you
picking up the same sort of big
government appr approach and making that
the foundation of your power and it
remains kind of midling not necessarily
that effective or it might result in
events changing but you didn't even
defeat the old establishment like brexit
did not actually change the British
establishment or break it in any way I'm
of course raising these in context of uh
Donald Trump's recent election win where
I think many people are very excited
about the possibilities of the future I
mean I am hopeful but I'm noting that
these outcomes exist right we have
political science case studies or even a
big electoral win seemingly driving a
big change kind of dissipates when
hitting administrative power and like
deep bench of people to hire from the
opposite team and you can call them
unelected and it's true but what are you
going to do they have government
salaries and authority and they can
disobey your orders and sometimes the
courts are on their side right and then
there's a question we alluded to it in
our last conversation of okay so you can
either rebuild the bench from scratch
but then there's a question of is it
possible that the existing sort of
officials can be converted in the sense
and you know in 2016 this was
unfathomable because the resistance was
so strong the ideological sort of hatred
of trump was so strong but eight years
later it seems like there's this been
this preference falsification wave where
a bunch of people who are secretly
supporting him for a bunch of years or
at least people who are neutral towards
him are now can now say so and maybe now
we'll have you know the exist people who
served Biden or who wouldn't have served
Trump a years ago maybe they'd have no
problem Ser serving for serving Trump
now it feels like the resistance just
isn't as as strong do you see that that
is I think they're they will be more
Cooperative to a great degree but I
don't think say Elizabeth Warren and her
allies would easily give up and if I
count the number of Live players it's
sort of like
you know I think the Democrats actually
have more the Democratic party has more
and the US deep state has more I mean
the other side of course you know Trump
plus Elon you should never uh
underestimate that that's that's pretty
amazing and Elon seems to be at least
for now like more obviously influential
than say perhaps Peter Teel might have
been in the 2016 Administration in the
2016 election that might have been a
more subtle form of influence and
perhaps it's related to the fact that
x.com is a form of populist power at
this point he can Shine the spotlight of
public opinion on all sorts of problems
all sorts of issues that otherwise would
not have gotten airtime like in 2016
there was no comparable social media
Network any right right I mean if Elon
said hey I'm doing this Fellowship where
I'm going to take a thousand people you
know of the best people in in sort of
business Tech what whatever to you know
work at the White House for a year or
two alongside me you know I bet he'd get
some great great people applying of
course but would he do it and can they
be
confirmed will the GOP actually
cooperate for example with Elon Musk
very unclear like the significant chunks
of the Republican Party are still deeply
hostile to Trump so they are not even
enabling him politically he is not in a
position of close Alliance as for
example between FES in Hungary and
Victor Orban Orban built that party over
many years from scratch it wasn't like a
hostile takeover right and the problem
is Trump ran a hostile Takeover in 2016
the voters love him but a lot of this
deep Republican establishment doesn't
and you know you can have examples of
people who cannot be confirmed and are
then given this title of AAR okay what
is AAR well you have an office in the
White House and you have the power to
convene people yeah okay you convene the
people for whatever Bureau you're
supposed to handle like immigration you
talk at them you tell them the president
really wants this they hear you they nod
and then they go back across the street
and go to a back to their office and
they do whatever they wanted to do so so
the difficulty here is that not having
the direct authority to remove people or
manage people is a severe
impediment and I think the confirmation
process will be contested from within
the Republican party and you might ask
well but why would why would the
Republican Party pass up this perfectly
fine opportunity to carry out a program
similar to what I said again the Victor
Orban program in Hungary where you
appoint people you you fire opponents
maybe give maybe you shrink the size of
government a little bit maybe reduce the
number of civil servants by great degree
maybe with elon's help at identifying
things maybe just do it you know assign
all the people each their own department
and relevant agenda however they do not
see a trump Administration and embedding
into the deep State as a win for them
they see it as a win for Trump and they
see it as a win for Elon while they
might like Elon I guarantee you
Republicans probably see him as an
outsider the Republican insiders they
don't like him any better so I think if
you could get through confirmation a
bunch of people from Tech and from
government this would work very well it
would work better than the Orban
strategy hey everybody Eric here with a
word from our sponsors
hey everyone Eric here you know at
turpentine we're always looking for ways
to streamline our work that's why we use
notion for all our internal documents
it's been a GameChanger for us and I
want to tell you why notion is this
amazing all-in-one workspace that
combines your notes docs and projects
but what's really cool is their new
notion AI it's like having multiple AI
tools built right in you can search
generate analyze and chat all without
leaving notion what sets notion AI apart
is how it personaliz responses based on
your content it's not just another
generic chatbot it understands the
context of your work plus it can search
across thousands of docs in seconds even
connecting to tools like slack and
Google Docs and get this notion is used
by over half of the Fortune 500
companies teams using it send less
emails cancel more meetings and save
time searching for their work it's
designed to keep everyone on the same
page while protecting your privacy want
to give it a try head over to notion.com
Upstream pod that's all lowercase
notion.com Upstream pod you can try
notion for free and when you use our
link you're supporting our show give the
powerful easy to use notion aai a shot
today at notion.com Upstream
pod now let me explain why I think the
Orban program is kind of basically a a
socially conservative program where
you're basically appealing to the
Hungarian baby
boomer and you're appealing to their
preconceptions and in a way there is no
deep bench of highly educated
intelligent people you have highly
intelligent people in business in Tech
who however have very little political
experience that is not necessarily bad
but only if you can replace
wholesale aspects of the function of the
previous political establishment as soon
as you are in a room you know let's put
this way Marco Rubio does that sound
like a name that's like a very different
foreign policy no I was I think people
are really frustrated or annoyed that it
seems like business as usual or or
confused as to why he picked rubia I
think it's just the Republican party I
don't even think it's the donors like
Donald Trump received significant crypto
donations by the way I do believe this
is a reason to be bullish on crypto you
know not investment advice but I do in
fact think that you know even at the end
of the day while Lina Khan was not ideal
lenina con was like not per was not
terrible and then now in fact it's very
likely that they'll try to replace
replace FTC and so on so I expect the US
to take a number of stances that are
going to be very positive on crypto and
Elon of course is pro crypto so I think
that'll do well and you know in a way
it's cool that you allow Elon to sue
what was it the Federal Aviation I
forget the FAA is is that yeah yeah yeah
it's cool that you can sue the FAA and
that like they let up on making you like
Chase down seals and and torture them
with sounds of rocket launches did you
see that yeah yeah where they had to
like demonstrate how distressed the
seals are so you have to kind of abduct
a seal and had to like play this audio
that was kind of insane but that's cool
but wouldn't it be even cooler if you
task the FAA directly to increase the
number of launches that their mandate
and their new kpi is the number of su
uccessful launches like that's cooler
right and I think to to do that you need
someone to run the thing and you need to
fire a bunch of people and you know I
think that the call could be made and
the key question is can they get it
through the Republican party so I think
perhaps not to Donald Trump surprise
because I'm sure he's seen this before
but perhaps to Elon surprise the big in
about a month or two it'll turn out that
the biggest obstacle to any great dreams
of reforming the American government he
has at this point will be the ostensible
allies of the Republican party right
because they you can't convince me that
it's not let's say the Marco Ruby
appointment is not straightforwardly the
Republican Party business as usual and
the Republican Party business as usual
you know I kind of don't massively care
if they run the country or if the
Democrats business Democratic party
businesses usual run the country because
I think while some things will be
slightly different it's much like
Hungary right it doesn't outperform the
counterfactual that much right slightly
more balanced budget maybe slightly
higher fertility you get to the same
place you're just going with a slower
speed and when I think about sort of
Democratic party as usual I mean some
people say it's like Obama some people
say it's like Pelosi Schumer there sort
of an nexcess of power what is sort of
the equivalent on on the Republican side
like what is Republican part business as
usual I mean first off to acknowledge it
was actually unclear whether president
Harris would have been the Democratic
party as usual I think both sides are
perhaps seeing a slow motion succession
failure there's a reason all the like
very formidable Democratic party
politicians except maybe Gavin Nome is
now still left in AOC they're all old
like Elizabeth Warren is getting quite
old now compared to the peak of her
career
like in six seven years she'll be like
an anti Pelosi like figure and anti
Pelosi's dislike you know Elder
Statesman from the 20th century just
still pulling all the strings kingmaker
of who gets to be the Democratic party's
president sorry presidential candidate
so I think that the Republican Party
side it's sort of you could imagine some
people like maybe R Rand Paul doing
something interesting but
outside of trump himself they're
shockingly little let's put this way the
most interesting right-wing political
figure right now is uh center right it's
like Elon Musk the second most
interesting one is Donald
Trump and I almost don't care who number
three is I don't think they're there
it's sort of like maybe the Mavericks
right the people like like literally
Tuli
rvk but none of those people are going
to get confirmed it's not looking
currently like they're even going to try
to get them through so Personnel is
policy and I think if one were to
pursue pursue this for real I think what
one is really doing is trying to recruit
first trying to beat your own ostensible
political allies so they allow the
appointment of true Outsider Talent
number one once that is done use the
outsider talent to actually key chunks
of the administrative State because the
real power in the United States lies in
the administrative State not in the
elected office it's very telling for
example that you know when I talk to my
conservative friends they're convinced
Joe Biden was not running the country
but as soon as Joe Biden leaves the seat
and Donald Trump enters it they are
convinced Donald Trump is running the
country
maybe the country's not run from that
seat maybe it hasn't been in
decades and you know maybe that sounds
like to my conservative friends that
sound like cold water to my liberal
friends that sounds like fresh hope the
resistance isn't going to be like as
loud and people will play on the
Republican team now right so previously
the resistance was almost explicitly
Democratic party coded it was the never
Trump stuff but it was nominally it was
a Democratic party restraining Donald
Trump it was the sort of left side and I
think currently the right side is going
to be constraining Donald Trump and then
as soon as you have party infighting in
a populist context that gets very tricky
you can say that this person is like you
know not actually a loyal Republican you
can pull your support from them running
in the race uh but that doesn't mean you
can put your own candidate to win that
constituency let's think about things
like midterms so you can have a disloyal
ostensible Ally if you try to replace
them in their elected position for the
purposes of pushing them to agree to the
confirmations you know they would just
be replaced by a
Democrat yeah fascinating it's actually
like the game theory is not that
clean and you know perhaps and this
sounds kind of funny but you know I it's
kind of expensive it's sort of like if
you wanted to have say a a proper Tech
takeover of the United States and I was
Elon I would open this fund and I would
go to all of my friends who are now so
you know they're congratulating me for
my genius they're congratulating they're
all down for it they're wearing the Maga
hat they're saying nice things about
Trump they're excited to go to Mars and
you're like oh this is so good will you
pledge $2
billion or $500 million to this fund I'm
creating and this fund's purpose is
literally to go around and buy
Republicans from their old donor base
fascinating get them off their old donor
base like literally target targeted
bribes you were dropping too much
interesting ideas that you got censored
um you got got immediately cancelled
yeah yeah yeah saying targeted bribes no
no no I I I I I would just
say be an alternate constituent right be
alternate funders of political campaigns
be alternate lobbyists just raise let's
say 40 billion do or 20 billion do
sounds like a lot of money but 20 to 40
billion to buy the Republican party I
guarantee you no one has attempted that
at the end of the day you know there's a
question well why shouldn't Elon fund it
it's like well he already spent 44
billion buying Twitter and you know
clearly this did not seem like a great
financial choice at the time now perhaps
it'll turn out to have been a great
financial choice I guarantee you it
would not have been had this election
had the Democratic party won this
election so you want to do this so that
people are
committed and you know it's not like the
other team ever had difficulty raising
10 or 20 billion dollars of donations
from Silton Valley people once they put
their name and money on the line cannot
walk it back so
that's that's that's a big deal like
that's a big deal basically you want
other people to stake on your team so to
you know basically provide what I think
would be a winning strategy for a proper
fast growth us I think the solution is
to have all of the fair weather Trump
enthusiasts among Silicon Valley Elites
commit a significant amount of money to
a fund and the fund is used to Lobby
establishment Republicans and wean them
off their pre-existing donor base
because they're pre existing donor base
is tied basically to the paper belt
right you know we might not think of
Wall Street as the paper belt but it
kind of is and Wall Street Ron and so on
the classic defense industry even parts
of sort of oil right I think this this
kind of has to be done that would be one
possibility there are other ways but I
think that's the best one I think the
the carrot might work better than the
stick because the stick is you know
Trump denounces you and you lose the
election well if you do that to me then
my seat goes to the Democratic party so
it's like a very limited strategy yeah
one thing Elon is good at doing is
putting pressure on you know we go to a
lot of things obviously but you know
raising money evangelizing and putting
pressure so I suspect if if you know
Republicans are acting out of line or
really trying to sort of thwart him he
will put them on blast uh
in a way that perhaps I mean Donald
Trump was never bad at that either but
we saw what the first Administration was
like it was a constant sort of like
trying to work with establishment
figures who three months later
inevitably betray him and then all of
the Trump supporters inevitably telling
me that this is actually brilliant and
was the plan all along and that the next
one's going to be different there were
just four years of that did people
forget yeah but Trump didn't own Twitter
and he's not Elon that's true yeah
obviously get Trump could get banned
from Twitter Elon cannot get banned from
Twitter and you know Trump doesn't get
banned from Twitter now either yeah and
and also the social you know Zuck
complimented you know Trump and you know
it seems like even the social networks
or at least meta is not beholden to the
Democrat Party anymore maybe Google
still is I I don't know but it's a it's
a new sort of Battlefield or it's a new
digital sort of space and we'll see
we'll see what that means well I do
think that the digital space and the
popular support are important
and controlling perceptions is important
however I want to point out that you
know the New York Times is still there
Harvard is still there the
administrative state is still there I
think there is a postelection high but I
I don't think it's going to last I think
that the messiness of this politics is
going to show that there's a limited
amount of things you can achieve with
populism right at some point you cannot
just pressure every single Republican
lawmaker and party operative you have to
have your own people you have to have
people who are loyal to you and that is
not the current Republican party now
from the Democratic party side from the
leftwing perspective this is sort of
good turns out the real checks and
balances in the American system was
internal party fracturing maybe the US
can't really have a one party State left
or right because too many people defect
on their own team all the time time you
know in China they have to use pretty
Extreme Measures to get the CCP to stick
to itself but I I I I do feel that the
challenge of governing a country after
one has achieved sort of the populist
success the first step is securing
control of the administrative State and
then only after you have really the step
of properly shrinking it right I feel
like first you have to have control then
you can maybe shrink it and I just think
that there is in theory a good
opportunity to do that over the next
four years and I would honestly be
excited to see it because I think the US
government kind of needs a partial
reform and reset of its key institutions
like you know all of the regulations
gone too far and the Ambitions gone out
of government it's been a very long time
since anyone was excited to work in
government so maybe there's an
opportunity to do that but it involves
the
transmutation of
popularity into basically legal power
and essentially like just having the
people who want to do the work for you
like if you're paying someone a salary
to do a job and they're just passively
kind of sabotaging your policy agenda
well that's a big problem isn't it yep
it is worth you know because we're
talking about populists populism and you
started the conversation by talking
about there's leftwing populism too and
you mentioned chabz Etc I mean in the
United States AOC would I would qualify
her as leftwing populism yes but but
leftwing populism is about sort of the
government doing things for you where it
seems like this popularism is I don't
want to say it's libertarian necessarily
but it's like you know get wokeness out
of our schools get it out of get the
trans stuff out out of the schools you
know it's sort of like it's somewhat
like you know get this sort of like Get
out of our spaces basically let us live
our Liv you know it's like let us sort
of you know not be blind sort of gas lit
or or something it's like a reactionary
populism basically but it doesn't seem
to be asking handouts in the same way
right well you know there there's
there's like a few differences here it's
sort of like in a way a direct handout
is perhaps more politically powerful
than getting out of someone's way
because they are directly dependent on
you yep and in the other one you are
protecting them from a plausible Danger
from the other side or from someone else
to meddle in their Affairs again and I
think people are more grateful for an
existing dependency than they are afraid
of you know meddling that hasn't yet
materialized I think that politically
there's a difference but the key the key
similarity is that you're trying to
build like vast popul
appeal you're trying to build popular
appeal for a measure and bring popular
opinion as a form of pressure mostly on
elected officials but even for example
on companies like boycotting conrete
companies right concrete companies
fearing bad PR and finally also just
sort of social pressure because no one
likes to be unpopular even if the public
has no direct mechanism to remove you
from your position if they really
dislike you uh you're going to try to
work on your PR just because it'll be
unpleasant to be the head of a of a
university or a school or a federal
agency or whatever exposed to that and
you might be closed opportunities in the
future because of it I I think this sort
of like difference that's it's this more
libertarian
strand like what I worry about about it
is that it's it's trying try to achieve
a vacuum and I think that if you say
let's let's say what would even mean to
get wokeness out of schools does that
mean like firing 80% of academics does
this mean that people would be happy to
not send their kids to college because
they're now fewer colleges or does it
mean that you fire 80% of quote unquote
woke people and then people who are from
the same social class educated with the
same degrees have the same opinions but
now know to shut up about them for about
four years get hired in and sure maybe
you know your daughter or son has like a
slightly less leftwing college
experience and you're a little bit happy
about that as a conservative parent but
don't we just end up at the same spot
you you you would you would have to
fundamentally like shrink the number of
people going to college for example or
you'd have to figure out hey what does
like a right-wing University exist like
how can someone make a career out of
being like I don't know like a free
market guy for example or being a Pro
Tech Guy in technology studies or
whatever in the university and that be a
good career move and that'll promote
them up and someday they'll get to teach
at Harvard because then they'll spend
their entire intellectual career doing
that right this was Curtis arvin's
critique of Chris rufo's activism
against critical race Theory where he
was saying hey you can Outlaw critical
race Theory but people are still going
to believe the same thing they'll just
call it something else and they'll find
ways to to espouse it but I but I wonder
if if the difference here is you know
Democrats just got just lost they just
got they lost the popular float and I
think there's cons consensus that you
know wokeness is not working and so
maybe there'll be internal pressure to
stop sort of conceeding to sort of maybe
Nicole Hannah Jones has way less power
than she used to have or way less sort
of credibility and people will say hey
like even internally on the democ like
you know we don't need to listen to this
and so and maybe that will sort of you
know who was out well well well this
election as a means to reform the
Democratic party I think might just work
but that's very different from what I
think people talk about by default no I
would totally agree with you that wi
within the Democratic party I think
marginally the faction that supports the
most you know the deepest push for
cultural War I think that faction's been
disempowered I think like the anti-crime
more socially moderate one has some
advantages I don't think that the big
government one has been like really
disabled within the Democratic party
though so it's sort of like imagine like
Gavin new some big government but now
it's like this now with 50% less crime
it's like you know I can't believe it's
it's it's not butter this sort of
rebranding where it's like oh we really
want is like you know clean streets and
a clean
environment and you know we we're going
to make America cities like Thrive etc
etc now if if they actually did that in
California you know that's actually a
solid argument for the presidency it's
not clear that's going to happen but I
don't think that the Democratic party is
moving away from
managerialism or from the administrative
State as the means to implement policy
like like does that make sense I'm like
evaluating it from this like kind of
like from the hey I want people to leave
me alone perspective and they're like
well we're not going to leave you alone
but the things we're going to tell you
to do are going to be less onerous right
so see that's the kind of Reform I
expect on the Democratic party side
right well it's interesting because
there's and I'm not sure if we've talked
about this before but this sort of the
you the Noah Smith Ezra Klein Derek
Thompson you know sort of like abundance
Pol you know leftism movement which to
me kind of seems like conservatism in or
at least free market like what they're
you know they want to deregulate housing
they want to what they they call supply
side liberalism but basically you know
deregulation you know housing they want
to get rid of sort of laws that prevent
us from building being able to build
they want to free up sort of the the
building I guess they would say they
want to you know increase State capacity
or industrial policy just like much more
effective government and they want to
focus on this you know Healthcare as
opposed to some of the culture stuff
because they realize that they're losing
the culture stuff I I think that that's
that's like in a way promising but I
feel that's a very intellectual and
coherent response and then the question
is who is the power base within the
Democratic party that backs this like I
could see like say a pragmatic gin Nome
sort of embracing Andrew Yang as his
like idealist side right and then like
it may be inviting no Smith to write a
policy paper but then as soon as no
Smith is like inconvenient I imagine
Gavin new dropping him in an instant
what never knew you I could see Dustin
moscovitz Reed Hoffman I mean these are
you know technocrat okay yeah increment
you know you know utilitarian you know
sort of uh pragmatic to some degree um
and so I could see them getting behind
such day I think one question I have is
does it have voter appeal But Eric that
would be still technology entering
politics just technology entering
Politics on the Democratic party side
which arguably was sort of attempted in
different ways by you know basically by
Bill Gates Eric Schmidt again Reed
Hoffman so on the the Hoffman seems
extremely motivated primarily by an
anti-trump agenda rather than a let's
make the Democratic party work agenda
yeah and I'm a you know big fan of reeds
Dustin moskovitz is is is a good
suggestion because we know for a fact
that you know he has donated huge
amounts of money which is very admirable
for some he believes in even if one
disagrees with what he believes in I
think that it's like he has basically if
someone is willing to give a lot of
their personal money to reshape
Society like I almost think that's
legitimate actually it's like it's like
you're putting you know it skin in the
game right like if you have like 202
billion and all you do is tweet I
probably shouldn't take your tweets that
seriously if you have $20 billion and
you give a billion dollars and create a
thing called the open philanthropy
foundation and you like you hire the
smartest nerds you can find to like
prevent the AI Apocalypse look I can
respect that there's no I just
believe you that that you actually think
this is extremely good for society so so
I don't know I think that there's there
is something there but I think someone
would have to seize the narrative and
say hey we lost because the people want
cheap electricity they want abundance
they want clean Safe Streets and on top
of that we can of course have all this
classic Progressive policies you want to
have a welfare state that's great we'll
fund it through exports we'll fund it
through cheap energy we'll just grow
enough right and in a way that was kind
of the Bill Clinton promise if you think
about it the modern democratic party is
way less technocratic way less pragmatic
way less interested in economic growth
than say the Bill Clinton era one was
yeah yeah that's right interesting but I
I I think we need kind of a a tech life
player to organize let's call it the
tech left even though calling it the
left almost implies that it's
Progressive let's call them let's
organize the tech liberals to pursue
this agenda and just actually deliver on
these Goods because I think if they
delivered on these Goods in California
look the rest of the country would want
to be California the Democratic party
has a state where they have free reign
they should use it they should make it
the most desirable place in the US and I
guarantee you other politicians will
then run on hey our state should be just
like California currently they're
running on our state will never be like
California thank goodness yeah the if
you had to guess what the candidate
looks like in 2028 on the
on the left or the archetype of the
candidate what would that guess be okay
I think AOC with kids is actually an
extremely really yes extremely potent
political candidate here's a vision of
the future I'm just telling you know
Eric would I think could work you're the
messenger yeah yeah don't shoot the
messenger so AOC has like one or two
beautiful children she shows up in happy
photo ops she says how after you know
the Trump election she really listened
to all those podcast people recommended
and you should realize that the
establishment was out of touch and you
know that Americans like you know
Hispanic Americans and white Americans
and and everyone right what we what we
really need what we really really need
is to have an America where you know
families can be prosperous again
workingclass families can be prosperous
okay and then that
rhetoric I think it can just literally
do her entire agenda you could just do
you know the green New Deal or whatever
after and no one would stop you li is I
think people very fundamentally respond
to the Optics and I think AOC in the
Public's perception is almost a single
woman but if the AOC in the Public's
perception is a married mom then I think
she's conservative enough to win okay I
think the first woman who's going to be
president in the United States would be
a conservative socially like like
personally conser conservative woman
she'll like seem like a family woman
she'll have to push a little bit so I'm
not a stay-at-home mom but I am a mom
I'm a family woman my family is the most
important thing to me and I'm here to
protect your family I'm not your HR lady
I'm a concerned mom why why do you think
that would have more appeal than like a
Josh airo or something like or more you
know Centrist well I think AOC is the
most charismatic Democrat and the second
most charismatic Democrat is Gavin Nome
who's a shark but kind of have to run a
a a dark Brandon style campaign you have
to run a like like dark Newsome it's
like sort of like oh you know their guy
is crazy but our guy is our guy is
sharper our guy can beat him in debate
and he's going to protect he's going to
protect the excellent people doing good
work by being absolutely ruthless and
look at him he's so competent and again
the Optics are just you know say what
you will but the photo op of gabin
nome's family with the dog is just like
beautiful right the the the the core
thing here is
that I think Americans want to feel a
personal
connection with their like head of state
and I think that's very normal in all of
human history people have wanted to feel
a personal connection with their head of
state I think it makes us feel safe I
think on a subconscious level all humans
are really terrified of
government yeah and you know if the king
or the Zar or the Pharaoh is the father
of the nation well then I don't need to
be that scared this is my dad right he's
going to protect me on a subconscious
level and you know the reason you know I
I don't know I like in terms of pure
Charisma who not who you agree or who
you like but in terms of pure Charisma
of the current field of Democratic party
politicians elected officials is there
anyone who's in the same category as
let's say AOC and maybe Gavin is more
like a slick politician he's not quite
Charisma but it's so practiced and so
done perfectly he feels like you know a
high like like if we ask gen Chachi PT
generate a California Democratic party
president like what did they look like I
think they would just it would probably
generate something close to Gavin
Newsome like like optically he just
looks that way yeah I I don't know if
it's could there be a trump of the left
like could Mark Cuban or some someone
like that come out of nowhere and you
know build a build an AUD I mean maybe
because the Republicans are well well I
think they would have to be have a
social media following yeah of course
right and that's why again sorry I hate
to bring it back to AOC but a AOC does
do the social media game super well I
think behind Donald Trump second most
skilled person at social media yeah
Cuban's not bad but she he's no he's no
AOC exactly but but maybe he'll get
better right like people can get skills
and and I do think like for example
there's this whole generation of if I
have to predict where the next
generation of Democratic party
politicians will come I think it's after
the Baby Boomers all depart I think that
you will see a sudden upswing in
Millennial social media personalities
running for office I think we might yet
come to see the influencer era of
congressmen so but I I expect that's
more like 10 years out because the
gerant tocy in both both houses is just
very severe it's still getting slightly
older every year but that can only go on
for so long like the current incumbents
will just you know nature will take its
toll yeah maybe as a as a last question
do you think blue cities will now be
more empowered to sort of be a bit more
conservative or a bit more hardlining
now that we shifted a little bit I think
so I think some Mayors will take the
opportunity to end up running their
cities in a very different way yeah that
makes sense is there anything yet
covered in this conversation or maybe as
uh any last points I think that we have
seen populism emerge as a phenomena in
the last decade because traditional
media has been
bypassed in fact this was a phenomena of
the internet it will continue to be
transformed by the internet so minor
changes in what happens to Tik Tok What
happens to
x.com what happens to Facebook and
Instagram what happens to YouTube
moderation policies these will have a
disproportionate effect on the success
of the populace strategy the populace
strategy is essentially gather a lot of
attention first public attention first
public support Second convert that into
to offices and positions of power this
is what allows party Outsiders Across
the Western World to enter into politics
it's the same in Italy Britain Poland
the United States and so on and populism
is a strategy in this sense in this
narrowly defined sense where we're not
talking we're not saying this is small
government or this is socialism because
each of those depending on how you frame
them both of them actually have a lot of
popular appeal like if you look at
General opinion polls you can like
slightly rephrase how you are in favor
of this or that policy and it swings 60%
vote 60% of the population either way so
what I think we're going to see in the
western world is this question of can we
survive Live players entering into
politics and being in constant friction
with the administrative state is this
the new balance of power where it's
productive and where these states
actually become better and more agile or
is this a transition period between one
form of administrative state to another
and left or right eventually people will
have to embrace let's call it the EU
approach of just censoring the internet
until the populists go away and let the
Insiders run their things the way they
have run them to be clear I don't think
that would work super well but I'm not
convinced the constant bumping in
friction between we can almost call it a
deep state if we want to let's call it a
deep State and populist upstarts owered
by social media I don't think this works
very well so I think we're struggling to
find a model of digital democracy that
actually works and perhaps digital
democracy procedure software in the
minarchist version maybe it can replace
the administrative state but then you
need a deeper vision of Reform you need
a new political economy you cannot just
be using the will of the people as this
constant mobilized check on the
administrative State because when the
people aren't paying attention the
administrative State just does what it
does and they're by default Ser of your
enemies so we need to find a new
political Harmony yeah that's a
fascinating note to to end on Sam this
