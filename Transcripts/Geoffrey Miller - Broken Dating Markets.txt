0:00
I've done polls of my my undergraduate males in my sexuality classes, anonymous polls, right,
0:06
through eye clicker and stuff. Would you ever date a female student? Would you ever date a female student
0:12
that you meet on campus? About twothirds say absolutely not.
0:17
What's the point of going to Oh my gosh. I know. And then, right, so they're terrified. Right.
0:23
Would you like to know more? Hello everyone. And I'm so excited to see all of you here today because today
Welcoming Jeffrey Miller
0:29
I have both Malcolm and Jeffrey Miller on the podcast. This is really exciting because one, we admire his work a lot.
0:35
Jeffrey Miller is an American evolutionary psychologist. He's also an author and associate professor of psychology at the University of New
0:41
Mexico where he teaches a course on human sexuality among other things. He's also mixing with university students who
0:48
are in the thick of dating, which is what we're going to be talking about today. Dating markets are broken. What
The Broken Dating Market
0:53
do we do to fix them? How can people find a partner if they actually want one? So, we're really excited to get into this. Welcome to Base Camp,
1:00
Jeffrey. It's great to be here and great to see you guys again. Great. And I want to note that this isn't just like if you're a young person
1:06
and you're like, "Oh, I'm interested in this for me." This is also going to be highly useful to parents because any
1:13
parent right now who wants their line to continue. One of the biggest challenges you're going to have to overcome is how
1:20
do you secure a partner? How do your children secure a partner within this corrupted market right now?
1:25
Yeah. Yeah. It's bad. It's dire. What are you seeing out there, Jeffrey? Like, do your students talk to you about
Campus Dating Policies
1:31
dating at all or are they like, "I'm not not going to go there." Are they not dating? Yeah. Well, they they want to be dating.
1:38
You know, the guys want girlfriends, the the women want boyfriends, and I actually have a daughter who's 29 and,
1:45
you know, active in the dating scene. And we talk a lot about what it's like out there. I talk a lot about the
1:51
current dating apps and their failures and their frustrations with my students. We have, you know, long discussions both
1:57
in my human sexuality class and I also teach a course on effective altruism. I teach courses on human emotions and
2:04
motivations and yeah, I've even taught a course on alternative relationships. It covers all kinds of unusual things
2:11
including including traditional Christian monogous marriage as as an
2:17
alternative relationship. It so is though. What? So we get this impression
2:23
sometimes that younger generations are in some ways moving in a more tradition
2:29
because they're like all the other stuff actually. Are you seeing this this trad movement within your students?
2:34
Are you seeing it or is it just not I mean what in here in Albuquerque, New
2:40
Mexico, everything is a little bit behind the curve. I mean we're not Brooklyn. We're not the Bay Area. So
2:45
stuff comes here five years later, you know, after after it goes everywhere else. But I certainly see an interest in
2:56
getting serious about finding a long-term mate and people talking about demographic collapse and people being
3:03
aware of it as an issue. And certainly my, you know, 20-year-old students talk
3:09
to their 40 to 50ish year old parents, right, who are also keenly concerned
3:15
like we want grandkids. When are you going to deliver grandkids to us? And so
Dating App Frustrations
3:21
there's a lot of discussion about that. And there's widespread frustration with dating apps, right? A lot of a lot of
3:27
the kids are on Tinder and Hinge and they find it an incredibly frustrating,
3:33
demeaning, dehumanizing process in different ways depending on whether you're a woman or a man, right? But
3:40
there's there's widespread dissatisfaction out there and particularly on college campuses, right,
3:47
which used to be epicenters of the mating market, which used to be wonderful places to meet people. A lot
3:54
of that has been shut down actually quite cynically and deliberately by college administrators.
4:01
What? Wait, wait. Okay. So, how talk more about this? Yes. Okay. So, about eight or 10 years ago, I
4:09
was on our UNM college committee to revise our sexual misconduct policies.
4:15
Right. And so, this was setting the policies, rules, and norms about basically dating on college campuses.
4:22
And I've talked to a lot of other faculty other places who have been involved in this kind of thing. And
4:27
basically I would raise questions like look there there's there's trade-offs here like yes we want to minimize date
4:35
rape yes we want to minimize sexual harassment unwanted sexual attention stalking that's all bad but on the
4:41
upside it would actually be nice if our students could date each other right and
The Trad Movement
4:47
there are there are tradeoffs there where like if you have a policy that absolutely tries to minimize all
4:55
possible date rape Right? And that basically criminalizes people approaching each other like with
5:02
possible romantic intent. Right? I said, "If you're going to do that, you're going to stop the formation of couples
5:09
on campus." Right? And everybody else on the committee was like, "We don't care
5:15
about the college campus being an effective mating market. We do not care.
5:21
The only priority we have is to absolutely minimize unwanted uncomfortable sexual attention. Right?
5:28
So a lot of campuses have gone in that direction and the net result is like when I went
5:34
to college in the 80s. Yeah. Like it was partly to find a marriage partner and partly to practice medium to
5:40
long-term relationships and like figure out what the other sex is like and how like this is so common that I even grew up
5:46
was this concept of a MRS degree which is MRS MS degree. instrument that you were going college to find a husband and
5:53
this was a viable strategy. Many many many many I I I might even say it was a normative strategy for our parents'
6:00
generation. Well, and you went to college looking for a wife, Malcolm, and your brother found his wife like freshman year.
6:05
Freshman year. Yeah. Both me and my brother went to college explicitly to find a wife in in part.
6:11
But now, wow. You know what you're saying, Jeffrey, reminds me it's it's like very similar to what happened like or has been creeping up with parenting
6:18
in general where like car seat laws may be causing fewer lives to exist in the
6:23
United States, for example, just because they're so prohibitively cumbersome. Um, then they're they're actually, you know,
6:30
saving. Like this this interest in in protecting people at all costs at the cost of even growth of the thing we're
6:37
protecting is is pretty insidious. It's pretty wild. I mean, I almost feel like there should be some kind of index on
6:42
like dating friendly colleges because I know many parents are still the only reason they're they're saving in their
6:47
529 accounts and they're actually planning to send their kids to college is they're like at least this is where
6:52
they'll find their partner and and here like now the universities are like, "No, no, definitely not. Don't even think
6:59
about it. That's crazy." Yeah. So, if if you're a parent and you actually want your kids to be able to
7:05
find possibly a spouse or at least enjoy long-term relationship and use college as among other things a mating market,
7:13
call the college's dean of students and ask what exactly are your policies? Are
7:18
you a dating friendly campus or are you all about like absolutely minimizing like sexual
7:26
sexual contact? Right? call them up and ask them because it's often the dean of students and you know to some degree the
7:34
DEI officers and and so forth. It's the administrators who are pushing this kind
7:39
of stuff and and and it's often the the the students don't really
7:46
know the ins and outs of it. All that they know is that there's a general chilling effect, right? And that they're
7:53
getting signals that it's not cool ever, right? to ask out anybody on campus,
8:00
right? And I've done polls of my my undergraduate males in my sexuality classes, anonymous polls, right,
8:06
through eye clicker and stuff. Would you ever date a female student? Would you ever date a female student
8:12
that you meet on campus? About twothirds say absolutely not.
8:17
What's the point of going to Oh my gosh. I know. And then, right, so they're terrified, right? because they know if
8:26
they're accused of sexual misconduct, they can get thrown out and that they've racked up student debt and they don't get a degree and it's it's nightmare.
8:34
It's horrifying. And so like I ask, who who do you date then? And they're like, well, I go to
8:39
the local community college or I just I've given up on dating already at age 20 and it's a nightmare.
8:48
That is wild. What do you also pull your female students are and are they having
8:54
like are there interesting asymmetries also that you're noticing between men and women willingness to date? I mean
8:59
there have been some things that have gone viral on Tik Tok recently where young women are like I'm going out my
9:04
tits bouncing. I just wish someone would cat call me. Like they're really getting to the point where they're getting frustrated because no one's paying attention to them I guess because
9:10
there's so much liability around it. Are you seeing like what are you seeing in terms of different experiences dating
9:16
between men and women that could be a leading indicator of something interesting? I think the young women are not aware of
9:23
just how terrified the young men are about these campus misconduct policies. They're not tuned into this. Like they
9:30
know ah this is weird. Nobody's dating me, approaching me, trying to talk to me. Why not? Right? Part of the issue is
9:37
sex ratio. So a lot of college campuses it's roughly two women for every man.
9:43
It's getting to like 60% female which or so 1.5 to two women per per man. And
9:52
that a as you guys know shifts the the power in the mating market
9:59
towards male short-term mating. Yeah. Right. And and this is great study on this. By the way, just a
10:05
side note here. I don't know if you've heard of this study, but there was a study that looked at the percentage of women on college campuses and dating
10:12
norms within college campuses. And the more women you have on a campus as a
10:18
proportion of the the the more promiscuity you get, whereas the fewer women you have, the more monogous relationships are.
10:24
Yeah, that's right. And that's that's what all the data seem to seem to show. And so if you get female dominated
10:30
campuses, you might think naively, oh that gives women the power to set the norms in
10:36
terms of relationships. No, no, no. Right? The sex that is in higher demand and it has heterosexual dating market
10:43
has more power. So the men have more power and that means they can impose, you know, to to the degree that men are
10:49
on average more interested in short-term mating and casual dating and casual sex and hookups, right? Then the women are
10:55
kind of forced into that. And that's exactly why when Tucker Max and I wrote The Mate Book 10 years ago, we said like
11:02
if you're a young man, you should try to go to a campus that's, you know, got a high proportion of women and you'll have
11:08
more bargaining power there. But if you're a young woman, right, you want to go to like
11:14
Caltech or one one of the rare kind of engineering oriented schools that's a little bit more male-dominated.
11:20
Smart. Oh, the good tactical tips coming in. Although I do wonder if if calling the dean of students would work if
11:27
you're talking about a religious conservative university because they do often have like I mean BYU for example
11:32
has some pretty strong I've talked with fans of the show and the number of them who want to go to BYU is actually really high like most of
11:38
them are very strongly considering BYU to find a wife and all of the Catholic parents that we talk with are like well
11:43
obviously my kid's going to find their their spouse at like one of these eight Catholic universities
11:50
but I mean they also have strict rules but they're rules oriented toward monogamy, I guess.
11:55
Yeah. So, look, if you're a parent, the the bottom line is don't just choose
12:01
whatever university you think will have the highest prestige, will be most helpful in terms of your kids' career
12:06
and and like that you can brag about like to your your extended family and
12:12
your neighbors, but really think strategically about it as as a mating market. And even even if it's not kind
12:21
of a hardcore Catholic or Mormon university, at least find out like do
12:26
the administrators think it's okay for students to date each other. They basically really discourage that. And
12:32
like I wouldn't necessarily want one of my kids to get married at age 21, but I
12:38
would want them to be able to have the experience of having at least some medium-term relationships to kind of
12:43
like calibrate like what do I want from, you know, a potential partner?
12:50
What different advice would you give to a son versus a daughter on the dating
12:55
market and to your male versus female students? Because I mean that's very different tactics. Honestly,
Personality Disorders in Dating
13:02
the when I'm teaching my human sexuality class, the thing that gets the most
13:07
interest is identifying personality disorders to avoid and and the red
13:14
flags. So, the women are very interesting. Yeah, the women are very interested in like
13:19
yeah, I'm kind of attracted to bad boys, but I actually want to avoid like really hardcore psychopaths,
13:27
narcissists, machavelians, like all that dark triad stuff. And for the men, I
13:32
talk quite a bit about borderline personality disorder and how it will
13:38
wreck your life if you're not careful. But how how do you how do you spot this
13:44
stuff? Yeah, I mean that that's a whole tangent, but you know, because a lot of them are
13:50
to anyone who's dating, you know, everyone's like, "No, really." Like, we're talking about how you get Skittles here and now it's like, "How do
13:56
you avoid the poison ones?" And you're like, "Wow, you know, that's a whole other conversation." And it's like, well, it is important in the acquisition
14:02
of Skittles to not get poison Skittles, to avoid poison Skittles in the mating
14:08
market. Okay, for borderline, for avoiding women with borderline personality disorder, right? You want to avoid
14:15
any signals of extremely high risk seeking, which is drug abuse, alcohol abuse, bad driving,
14:22
frankly, even extreme sports. You you want to interrogate them about their attitudes towards exes, right? If they
14:30
diss every single man they've ever gone out with and like, "My father sucked. My ex-boyfriends all suck." Like, maybe
14:37
it's you. Maybe it's not them. maybe the common denominator is like you
14:42
pick badly and then drive men away. If you get into a relationship with a
14:47
borderline, then they tend to flip-flop between idolizing you and demonizing you. Right? So, one hour they'll be
14:55
like, "You're the best thing ever. I feel so connected to you. This is awesome. I'm more in love with you than
15:00
ever." And then an hour later they're having an argument and they're saying, "You're you're just, you know, the worst
15:06
piece of shit ever and I don't trust you at all." and so that kind of instability
15:12
in how they interpret other people's social behavior. Another big red flag for
15:17
borderline women is they don't have any female friends, right? Because they they burn through all their
15:22
their same-sex relationships because other women are are sick of dealing with their their nonsense.
15:29
So that's my my capsule twominute lesson. That's really good. No, those are really
15:34
easy to spot. So that's amazing. Yeah. All right. Now, let's talk about like dating apps as a dating opportunity
Dating Apps and Passport Wives
15:42
right now. And I also want to talk about Passport Bro wives because these are two
15:47
areas where you're actually seeing tons of wives. We had an episode on just how common Passport bro wives are. And
15:52
people one hugely underestimate this. In Korea, if you look at rural rural Korea,
15:59
one in four wives are from another country. If you look at Sweden or Norway and you look at immigration rates, you
16:06
would think that the immigration rates would lean male because you're getting so many immigrants from like Middle
16:11
Eastern countries, but it actually turns out that they're gender equal because you get so many passport wives from
16:17
Russia and South America are the two poor places they're coming from. So, I'd love it if you could talk about these two pathways.
16:24
So, I know a lot more about dating apps than about passport wives. In terms of the passport situation,
16:31
yeah, I I I mean I all I can say is that
16:37
if you are concerned about finding, you know, a traditional monogous marriage and having a bunch of kids, then you
16:44
need to find somebody who is from a culture or a nation or a subculture that has been open to that and encouraging of
16:51
that. And it's it's really hard if you grow up in a subculture that is
16:58
systematically opposed to long-term marriage and having kids like frankly a
17:04
lot of American culture is. I can see the appeal of just trying to,
17:09
you know, find a mate where you can. And there's a long tradition in human evolution of people mating outside their
17:16
tribe, right? We are all genetic hybrids and mongrels to to one degree or
17:22
another. And partly that's because people growing up in a particular clan or tribe are related to everybody.
17:30
So you don't necessarily want to marry your cousin or your second cousin. But also we're we're intrigued by
17:35
cultural difference as long as it's not too too different. So that that's really all I can say
17:41
about the passport wife thing. I do worry that often
17:47
people might be matching up with others who seem like, okay, maybe they share
17:52
some core family values, but there's a whole bunch of other cultural baggage, right? That comes
17:58
along with other cultures that you might not even be aware of, right? You get you get some wife from Lithuania or or
18:05
Namibia or or India or whatever. And unless you have a deep deep
18:10
understanding of that culture and all the expectations around mating and parenting and so forth and how extended
18:18
families work in those cultures, right? That can be a real handicap. You can have some surprises and shocks. And the
18:25
other thing is, you know, the older I get, the more important I think it is actually to try, if possible, to stay
18:32
geographically close to parents and grandparents. Totally right. and to really leverage the power
18:37
of the extended family when you're raising kids together. So I love political theorist Yuram Hzonei who did
18:44
a great book called Conservatism of Rediscovery and he writes quite extensively about
18:51
kind of being based and grounded in an extended family that lives nearby and
18:56
the the many many benefits of that. So, you know, I understand the appeal of
19:02
getting a a kind of passport spouse, but just be aware that like if you're trying to raise kids and the kids' grandparents
19:08
are thousands of miles away and you're never going to see them, that's a major major handicap.
19:14
Yeah. Well, one thing I'm really interested in though, like just on this, is that
19:19
one of our listeners sent to me an essay, an article on American Reformer called Highway America is a relic of the
19:24
past that is essentially encouraging young men to do road trips, like a job
19:30
across a drive across the USA and just stop at every like diner and coffee
19:38
place along the way and like hit on attractive young women who are working there because it's it's almost implying
19:43
that You could be a passport bro domestically. There are all these women in flyover America that may be more
19:51
traditional and we should we should consider there
19:56
the if you go get a passport bro wife. I think a lot of people underestimate how far the urban monoculture reaches in
20:04
terms of it value system. And a lot of these women just want to use you. they'll say they want a lot of kids and
20:09
then after the like two kids they're like okay that's all I'm going to do because what I really wanted was was
20:15
stability and wealth and I already have that and I don't want the additional work now and that's not to say they all
20:20
do one one funny story I heard recently from a I don't yeah it was a fan in the
20:25
comments or something is they were talking about one of their friends no it might actually be like somebody I know
20:30
personally one of their friends wives who was a passport wife from some somewhere in East Asia and they they got
20:37
to four kids and then she's like, "You need to take another wife now." She's like, "I'm done with with these kids.
20:43
You this is too much work. You need another wife." And I'm like, a lot of people would see that as a very favorable outcome from a passport for a
20:49
wife that they're like, "Need more wives. What are you doing with only me?" But keep in mind that you know that you
20:56
are merging cultures and that can be a very difficult thing to do. But let's know I met my wife on a dating app,
21:02
okay, before it went crazy. I've said in my book I said it went crazy like it was bought by match group and they killed
21:08
the you know just full profile search full profile to to try to push people
21:13
onto the other more addictive swipe based system and the guy I actually said this in front of the guy who was in
21:20
charge of determining this change at one point. I didn't know he was in charge of determining this change and he's like no it was all based on the data more people
21:26
were using it after the change. It was okay you created an addictive cycle. Uh, of course more people are using it, but
21:32
basically any app that uses a swipe based system is not worth using as a guy. So, and the reason it's not worth
21:39
using is if you look at something like Tinder and you look at the average guy on Tinder, everybody knows this statistic. It's less than 1% of women
21:44
are swiping right on them. That's the average guy. That's 50% of men. So, 50% of men, less than 1% of women are swiping right on you. They are all going
21:51
to the same men. So it just doesn't really work at the system because it it means even for the top men, they have no
21:58
motivation to treat these women seriously and all these women who are using it end up feeling like every guy is just using them because it's every
22:05
guy that they're choosing within this ecosystem is using them. So they end up becoming super misandressous. But
22:10
anyway, what's your like what do you do? Yeah. And I I I would echo like when I
22:16
was using OKCid to date like 10 to 12 14 years ago, it was awesome. It was So
22:22
good. And I I think I answered literally all of the 3,000 plus
22:29
you could sit up there and farm attention. You'd end up in people's feed with your answers. Simone came up with a unique system
22:35
where she would do the answers in long form so that it would show up on people's feeds. Oh, I see. That's clever. Yeah. But
22:42
yeah, the match group absolutely killed it. and they are now in the business of
22:49
monetizing subscriptions and eyeballs and not creating matches. The the stats
22:54
I've seen is that roughly one in five million swipes results in a
23:01
marriage. Oh my god. On those apps, I mean, it's literally less. You'd have to swipe
23:07
all day every day, particularly if you're a guy, right, to get even a
23:12
reasonable number of dates. And then because the algorithm isn't matching you effectively based on any kind of
23:19
psychological traits or life interests or politics or religion or you know interest in family formation and this is
Keeper: A New Dating App
23:26
why I've started working as a sort of consulting scientist with Keeper which is a new dating app that really tries to
23:34
help people who seriously want to get families right to find each other and
23:40
particularly based on deeper psychological compatibility. So yeah, I'm I'm interested in Keeper
23:46
because it seems to me like the new Match. So when I was on OkayCid, I was
23:51
just looking to date at that time. Like I didn't want to get married, but then there was another girl at my office who really wanted to get married. And so she
23:57
went to match.com and then like a couple months later, she met the guy who then like one month later after that became
24:04
her fiance and they got married and like it was done. And we I'd known a bunch of people who just done that. It was like
24:09
match was for closers. And I think that's kind of fallen apart or it's not really for a demographic that's relevant to young people. And when I first heard
24:15
about Keeper, it was under it sounded so mysterious. It was like, well, you have to like put down $50,000 and then you
24:22
only get it if you get married, you know, like something like it required a ton of commitment. And I think it's changed a lot since then. But I was
24:28
really intrigued by like what are some smart people's entrepreneurial take to
24:34
like get people to actually commit because I feel like switching costs now are so low and the desire to actually
24:40
commit is so low that people even when they're matched with someone who's a really good potential partner they're
24:47
like she's not a Brazilian model like I'll pass. I'm not feeling it right now. They're not taking it seriously. So what
24:52
does Keeper do? because I think they had to walk back the financial commitment part because I don't think they were
24:57
going to get a lot of customers doing that. But like what's going on? So I mean the economic model is is
25:04
basically you want to make sure that the people who are on a serious dating app
25:09
are really actually serious about finding a long-term partner. So they do still have a marriage bounty plan where
25:16
you basically sign a contract that says for not just for marriage but different milestones of the relationship like you
25:23
know if you have been dating for a year or you're actually cohabiting or if you get married or even if you have your
25:29
first kid there's kind of an escalating payout structure right so that
25:34
basically your incentives to find the long-term mate are absolutely
25:41
aligned with the dating apps incentives in terms of revenue generation. And then there's
25:47
a second model which is basically you pay per contact, you pay per date, right?
25:52
Oh yeah, but I mean you do that on Ashley Madison. So you know that's not well but then
25:58
you're right. Ashley Madison is for people already married cheating, right?
26:05
So Keeper is strongly discouraging casual dating, cheating, etc. they they
26:11
actually, you know, are have ways to vet people in terms of their authenticity and their and their
26:17
commitment to to the process. So, I think what'll probably end up happening
26:22
more often is that Keeper is all about like quality over quantity. They're
26:28
really trying to find an extremely good match for each person
26:34
and they're sort of like suggesting here's the match we're going to give you
26:39
one at a time, right? We encourage you guys to like
26:45
communicate a little bit. If you want full contact information, then that's that's a little bit of a cost like a
26:52
couple hundred dollars, right? So you're not treating it as if it's like a
26:57
gamified like source of sexual validation like how many people are swiping on me and
27:03
like how many can I swipe on? No, just taking that off the table. The whole mental model of it is sort of like
27:10
imagine your parents or a trusted mentor or like here's a young woman I know and
27:18
respect who I think would be a great match for you young man and if I
27:24
introduce you right you're going to treat her like a real human being not just like a profile
27:30
right so that's the mindset it's a little bit more like traditional matchmaking but using like AI algorithms
27:37
and using the power of big data. So it's completely the opposite mindset of like
27:43
swipe swipe swipe left left swipe and and then like text and then get ghosted,
27:48
right? It's introducing the core failing of the swipe ecosystem which is switching
27:53
costs. Um the core failing of the swipe ecosystem is that there is always another and when there is always another
27:59
and there is incredibly low switching costs that then then people do not treat any particular relationship particularly
28:06
seriously. Yeah. How much are people putting down for bounties? Like what is what do you think
28:11
is a a compelling marriage bounty? I think so far typically the marriage
28:17
bounties are on the order of 10 20 $30,000 but some people are going up to like six
28:22
figures you know over 100,000 some people have put down like seven figure bounties like I will pay you two or
28:28
three million if you find me a good spouse and this is a this is a dating app where
28:34
the median male annual income is something like 170 $180,000
28:41
and like the top quartortile is mid6 figures. So, these are successful people
28:47
and a lot of them, you know, if if they're serious about finding a spouse
28:52
are willing to pay for it and they know like look, if if you're some
28:58
entrepreneur and or angel investor or whatever and you've got a serious net
29:04
worth, then finding a good wife or husband is is a massive life benefit.
29:11
How much is it worth to you? Right, to find someone who's a extremely compatible and wants to have a bunch of
29:17
kids with you and b where you're so compatible that the likelihood of a disastrous divorce is very very low.
29:25
It's funny when you mention marrying, you know, wealthy people and I think that this is, you know, different
29:30
classes often marry within the class and and my mom when when I was looking for a wife, you know, around the time I was
29:36
dating you, she's like, "Why don't you just go to Debbuton balls? You can you can find great wives at those. And I was
29:42
like, "Mom, how do you think I'm gonna get invited to a debutant ball? I live in effing like Scotland and San
29:48
Francisco. Do you think they're having debutant balls in San Francisco? You need to be aware of where certain like
29:57
groups are meeting within each generational pool and and update as that
30:03
switches." Yeah. And it it is a colossal failure
30:08
honestly of of you know older millennials and and Gen X like me and
30:13
the boomers that we have failed to maintain and update those kinds of informal or formal mating markets. Like
30:20
when I was in high school, there was a thing called cotilian, right? And if you were a sort of bourgeoa young man or
30:27
woman, right? You you would go to these things like four times a year and all the young men would dress up in tuxedos
30:32
and then they would dance to punk music and and you would get used to interacting with other people in in the
30:38
cotillian group as real people and often they were going to the same high school as you but you saw them in a new context
30:44
where it's like ah this is romantic there's candle light there's music it's it's at a country club that's cool but
30:51
what are the modern equivalents right church yes that can work college clubs
30:57
yeah But then you got the the sexual misconduct policies to worry about. Yeah.
31:02
Crossfit, right? Going to some demanding leisure activity that has a decent sex
31:08
ratio that can work. I mean, that's how my my co-author Tucker Max found his his wife. He's like, I'm going to go I'm
Finding Love Through CrossFit
31:15
going to go to CrossFit classes and I'm gonna find I'm gonna find a registered nurse.
31:20
Oh, right. So specific, right? and he he he tuned it in and he
31:27
and he found one and she's great and she's smart and now they have whatever four kids and live in rural Tennessee
31:32
and they're they're they're out there and he's teaching his kids how to do long range precision rifle shooting and
31:40
and it's the dream. Yes. Living the dream. That's so interesting. Okay. Well, so I
Arranged Marriages and Matchmaking
31:47
mean one thing that Malcolm and I talk about a lot is basically arranging marriages or very lightly arranging
31:53
marriages for our children or at least doing matchmaking. We've created this group of parents with kids of similar
32:00
ages to our kids. And then when they start hitting age seven, age eight, we're going to try to get them on like,
32:05
you know, summer camps together, vacations together, you know, hanging out, doing stuff together, you know, maybe once a year, once every other
32:11
year, so they start to get to know each other. and then later on a set of Discord servers, all sorts of
32:17
things. So like virtually they might like play video games together or something and then over time be like,
32:22
"Hey, you know, you're 21, you're 18, like have you seriously considered so and so?"
32:28
We we think that a lot of people aren't really talking about how really only until very recently in human history
32:35
have families and parents stopped becoming involved in their kids' matchmaking and dating lives. I mean,
32:42
now it's kind of considered weird for a family to even weigh in or provide an opinion on a boyfriend or girlfriend.
32:48
And I get it because you could lose your kid. If you like, you know, they insist they have to marry this person and you
32:53
hate them, then they're going to choose them and you lose your relationship with your kid. But on the other hand, you
32:59
know, I think a lot of a lot of people would appreciate having a little bit more help and guidance, even if they might complain about it. What are your
Parental Involvement in Dating
33:05
thoughts on getting involved in and meddling in your children's dating lives?
33:10
I'm all for it. I think absolutely. And you know, thankfully, like with my daughter, we talk quite a bit about her
33:16
her dating life and her relationships and her mate choice criteria. And she knows I'm like I've written books about
33:22
this, so I'm not just some random random old dude. But I think a lot of parents
33:28
have a real failure of nerve. I think they're absolutely gutless on this issue
33:33
and they need to weigh in and they need to start doing it from, you know, the
33:38
time their their kids are teenagers and be willing to say, "I just don't think
33:44
she or he is is right for you, but let me explain why and let me unpack it. Let
33:50
me give you my life experiences, right, that are my relevant source of wisdom
33:56
about how this particular red flag,
34:01
right, in this young person is going to play out in the future. So, the parents have to be articulate
34:07
about it. They have to connect it to their own life experiences. That requires a bit of vulnerability.
34:13
But I I see this this massive failure of parental duty like where oh yeah, you're
34:20
allowed to give your kids advice on education and career but not about mating.
34:26
And it it's so it's so dumb because like in retrospect
34:31
my parents when I was a teenager could have easily found like a dozen young
34:38
women who I would have actually had quite a happy marriage with. like they knew me better than I knew myself.
34:45
A fair point, right? They knew my my strengths and weaknesses, my tra traits, my quirks
34:50
because they were surrounded by, you know, other parents' kids. And they they were they were smart and observant. And
34:58
the notion that a 20-year-old knows themselves better than their parents do is in a way very narcissistic and very
35:06
strange. Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely. and and and like oh also
Integrating Family in Modern Dating Apps
35:14
you can weave together the parental advice and the dating apps right oh wait how
35:20
well like for example you could actually include your parents in the assessment
35:26
right now if you're if you're on Tinder right of course your parents aren't going to be standing behind your
35:32
shoulder like monitoring every swipe but if you're on like a keeper dating app where you're getting just one
35:39
hopefully really Yeah, you could match time, right? You could potentially share
35:44
it with them, Zoom with them, get their advice, and you have a rich enough set
35:49
of information about each potential mate, right? That the parents could look at that and go, "Yeah, well, actually,
35:59
let me explain to you why." Like, hopefully Keeper is even smarter
36:04
than you are about why this would be a great match or maybe why not, right? And so we we would I ideally want
36:11
to empower young people to like fold their family and their friends into
36:17
this dating app experience. I like that. So if if you're not comfortable doing it
36:23
with your parents, at least maybe do it with your siblings. At least do it with with housemates, with friends, whatever.
36:29
Don't keep it as like your secret little vice like like Tinder hinge where it's like I just do this to be like a
36:36
solopscistic like secret of sexuality. It's interesting you mentioned this. One of the things we talk about on this
Cross-Cultural Differences in Spouse Vetting
36:42
channel a lot is cross-cultural differences and a big difference across the American cultural groups and you can
36:48
go to our videos on the backwards cultural tradition and everything like this and the various cult is is some groups like the backwards cultural
36:54
tradition which is like the Appalachian cultural tradition primarily vets spouses through siblings and then other
37:01
groups primarily vet spouses through parents. And I I just happen to be
37:06
through a culture that primarily vets spouses through siblings. And so this is to say that there are many ways that you
37:12
can build a vetting system for spouses that rely on people who know you better and rely on the crowd opinion. But the
37:19
crowd opinion is always going to be better than your individual opinion. And and I know that as a society we have
37:25
completely atomized romance, but it's really stupid, especially if you want to get married as young as you need to to
37:30
have a lot of kids. Recently we did an episode, I don't know when it'll go live, but it was on we need more teen
Teen Marriages and Parental Guidance
37:36
marriages. And the problem, the biggest problem with teen or young marriages is, and I mean young, you know, early 20s,
37:43
whatever, is that you don't fully know yourself yet. You don't know who you're going to become. And you're not fully
37:48
mileinated, but your parents and your friends, like aggregately, the people
37:53
around you know you, the people who have a vested interest in your future know you. And this is why so many societies
38:00
used people like that for marriage choosers of these. And people can be like, well, what about love? And it's
38:06
like, well, you know, love isn't it didn't exactly evolve within a context that's meant to choose as a perfect
38:12
spouse. It's meant to make you love whoever you think is going to be the the parent of your kid because, you know,
38:19
then you don't kill them or the kid or anything like that. It's it's not meant to be a spouse choosing mechanism within
38:25
an evolutionary context. Yeah. And I'll just just for those who are brothers, sisters, moms, dads who
38:32
are listening to this and thinking like, how can I get involved in a way that's meaningful? Malcolm actually his whole family got involved in in pitching me to
38:39
him kind of like one Malcolm participated in that very early on in our dating even when I was under the
38:46
impression that we were never going to get married. You introduced me to your dad. It was like your mom or something.
38:53
It was it was with you you introduced me to your in like the first and then after we broke up you you literally you were
39:00
out of the country and you had me go to dinner with your parents who were in town and then after we got back together one
39:06
so like his brother and sister got involved just hammering Malcolm on like you need to marry her she's right for
39:12
you. Wait do you remember this? Wait, what do you remember about also that they they
39:17
were just like Malcolm in that way that they always are. How come? You need to just she you're not going to find anyone
39:23
else. You're, you know, you're impossible. She's the only one who'll deal with you. And then your mom started
39:28
sending both of us engagement rings that she found on first dibs.
39:33
And she just kept sending the rings and sending the rings and sending the rings and then being like, "Oh, I'm going to come, you know, visit. You should
39:39
propose to her here. You should propose to her there." And she's just like a constant force in both of our lives. making it really top of mind and making
39:46
it like I think a lot of parents just aren't necessarily thinking about like how do people think about doing this
39:52
like the reason I got married at the age I got married at and I think that a lot of people they don't they don't see this
39:57
is I had a a family that was around me constantly telling me to get married to
40:03
this person and they didn't say this for other girls I dated they didn't they actually they had never said this about
40:08
any girl I dated before that you need to marry this girl they even moved up the timeline they actually moved up like his family moved
40:14
up the timeline because I was like, well, I want Malcolm to propose to me when he can through his work afford to
40:19
pay using his own salary for an engagement ring. I just I don't know like it was it's a stupid thing on my I
40:25
don't know why I said that, but I did. And Malcolm's mom was like, "Oh, it's
40:30
just that." And she like pulls off her earring, which is just this like big diamond, and she like slides it across
40:36
the table, and she's like, "All right, turn this into a ring because you can afford this." like she's just like she was like okay you know what do we need
40:42
to do to to close her her like her constant phrase to the family was dinners for closers. She just was always
40:48
about like let's get it done. And I I think parents when they think about getting involved maybe they think about
40:53
nagging. Maybe they think about like I think you have to think about this like a salesperson. Like where is the
40:59
friction and how can I remove that or how can I keep this top of mind? Like what's my drip campaign? Where's the
41:05
propaganda? So, okay, Jeffrey, you're you're you're totally trapped now because I'm gonna put you you on on our
41:10
list of of matchmaking families for your youngest daughters because, you know, we've got we've got really great young men for
41:17
them to consider later on in life. And I
41:24
I mean, American culture is like, oh, it's really creepy to think that far ahead, but it life is short and life
41:30
goes by fast. And you know the standard parental advice is like the days are long and the years are
41:36
short and before you know it your toddlers will be in high school and then they'll be looking for mates and
41:41
frustrated. And you know another issue here is like apart from the collective wisdom of the extended family and the
41:48
parents and the siblings. It's also really really helpful to get to know the
41:55
family of a potential mate early, right? Because of heredity, because traits are
42:02
heritable, right? Don't look at the woman, look at her mom because then you know how she's going to age.
42:07
Yeah. So, you want to be able to integrate information about all these phenotypic traits, right? All these
42:13
physical and and mental traits, physical and mental health, right? And this is
42:19
another one of the many reasons for pronatalism in big families is you just get a bigger sample size of what are the
42:25
genes in this family like it's true. And so like there was a funny asymmetry where when my dad as a long young lawyer
42:33
age circa 26 started dating my mom age 19 college student. My mom had 11
42:39
brothers and sisters right big family. Wow. So my dad could meet all these
42:45
siblings and just see the the mosaic of traits, right, expressed in all these
42:52
siblings and get a much better kind of estimate of what my, you know,
42:57
19-year-old mom was going to be like versus my dad was an only child. So she had to assess him just based on him and
43:05
his parents and that's pretty much it, right? So, one hidden cost of very very
43:13
small families is it makes potential suitors less
43:19
confident about like what what really is this person like because I can't see
43:25
the way that similar genes are expressed in siblings and parents. Yes, that's really interesting. There's
43:31
there's even this old Victorian dating guide that was written where the the author was also like just don't date an
43:37
only child. they're going to be too selfish and their parents clearly failed to thrive. Like that just he just like
43:42
was completely writing off all single children even in the Victorian age. There's there's there's got to be some wisdom to this.
43:49
Yeah. I I actually don't think it's it's the case that the single kids are sort of messed up psychologically per se.
43:55
It's just you don't know as much about the genes that they likely to carry
44:00
because you don't have as big a sample of of their relatives. 100%. Yeah, that's a really good point.
44:06
Okay, final final rapidfire question. In what way or to what scale do you think
AI Boyfriends and Girlfriends: A New Challenge
44:12
we're totally super screwed by AI boyfriends and girlfriends coming online
44:17
and providing basically the ultimate sink for anyone who decides like I am
44:23
just going to just focus on hedonism and this perfect boyfriend girlfriend that I
44:30
can you know eventually plug into a very responsive sex doll like whatever right like it's going to get way more advanced
44:35
than it is now do you think that we're super screwed or are we just going to lose a certain portion of the population
44:40
that only cares about a certain type of pleasure? What do you think is going to happen as this rolls out? I think it's a
44:46
it's a big big problem and I think we're going to be blindsided by it and I think it's going to actually affect young men
44:53
and young women about equally but in different totally agree right so yes the young men are going to
44:58
be able to get this like super attractive curvy vivaceious validating like
45:04
girlfriend and they'll be able to put on the virtual reality like headset and have like virtual sex with these AI
45:10
girlfriends sexy haptic suits yeah and and by contrast dealing with like
45:15
real women and all their their nonsense will become quite unattractive. But on
45:20
the on the other hand for the young women, right, they're going to get these AI boyfriends like chat GPT, which is
45:29
currently kind of my wife's secondary partner. Like we're by the way building better AI
45:34
girlfriends was rfab.ai for anyone who wants to check it out. Thanks. Just in case you wanted to like sterilize more people.
45:40
Yeah. No, we're in the early stages. Well, hey, Elon is doing it with Grock. we just have to beat him. Okay.
45:45
Yeah. Simultaneously through through one side of the mouth. And so the like if you read women's
45:51
romance novels, right, you know what women want and what they what they crave. And so if you have like AI
45:57
boyfriends that are on the one hand kind of like dommy and superior and they they
46:03
push the hypergamy button, right? where the women are like, "Oh man, I can't
46:08
believe such a such a bad boy, such a high status pirate captain is my own
46:14
personal werewolf conversation partner." But on the other hand,
46:20
you know, the AI boyfriends will be able to remember every single detail of the young women's lives, their birthdays,
46:26
their interests, their their pets. Like if the woman's like, "I love this movie." the AI boyfriend will
46:32
be able to like literally go off and and basically like watch every episode Yeah. of it and then be able to talk about it.
46:38
No. Every line, every reference. Oh god. And so real real young men who are like
46:44
distractable and have fallible memories and like insufficient attentiveness and
46:49
all that will seem really lame by comparison. So, I worry a lot about this
46:55
and I think it's one of probably my top five AI risks
47:03
that, you know, I I would be concerned about.
47:08
So, AI for matchmaking, great. AI for fake boyfriends and girlfriends
47:14
could be very dangerous. But on the like, okay, what's the silver lining?
47:20
You could potentially design an AI boyfriend or girlfriend that is specifically to level up social skills.
47:28
Yeah, a lot of people are arguing this. That's a good point. Yeah, maybe you could do that, but then you'd have to be really careful about how
47:35
exactly are the economics of the AI boyfriend girlfriend
47:40
software makers aligned really with the long-term interests of the users, right?
47:46
Is it really leveling them up or are they just getting a kind of gamified like way to
47:53
overcome my alleged autism kind of thing? Yeah, I don't know. The way dating apps
47:59
have devolved on the broader scale aside from, you know, some of the more innovative really resultsoriented ones
48:05
suggests outlook not good. But I don't know. I mean, part of our approach that we're taking with our kids is more like
48:13
if you want pleasure, sure, use AI for that. But marriage is is as much a
48:19
career choice, a survival choice as it is I mean it's it's really actually not
48:25
at all from our perspective about pleasure or romance. I mean it's it's
48:31
great if those things are there and that that should you know compatibility is important etc etc but like we we're
48:38
trying to raise our kids to not think that because I mean we for the vast majority of human history and maybe I
48:44
mean you can comment on this because you're probably way more informed on this from an evolutionary psychology perspective but for the vast majority of human history human pair bonding has not
48:52
necessarily been about romance or love and yet now people modern people are
48:58
expecting a cortison without paying them a salary, without having the budget for that. Like they
49:04
just want someone who will who will amuse and pleasure them, who is perpetually young and attractive when that's never been what marriage has been
49:11
about. I mean, it's been about like a sort of commercial, religious, familyoriented agreement. And we're
49:18
trying to reorient our children around that that all this romance stuff is this
49:24
other thing that is better handled with AI anyway. So, just use AI for that. and then think of marriage as something
49:30
completely divorced from it. But but how are you how are you thinking about preparing especially your younger kids
49:37
for for this? I mean there's some time you can see how it plays out a little. But what are your initial thoughts?
Preparing Kids for Future Mate Choices
49:44
I mean one one thing I talk about a fair amount with with both my wife Diana Fleshman and we also have a friend
49:49
Athena Actipus. Oh, she's so cool. Yes. Yeah, she's cool. She wrote a book called A Field Guide to the Apocalypse.
49:56
And the mindset there is like in terms of guiding kids in their mate choice.
50:04
Hedge your bets about what the future will be like, right? So the future might
50:09
be super high-tech and maybe we have benevolent AI and every everything gets easier, but the future might also be
50:16
post-apocalyptic. AI makes a lot of trouble. There are few survivors, right? How do you survive? Or
50:23
it might just be kind of a gentle grid down. you need to go into like prepper homesteading mode. Okay, so find a mate
50:31
who would be good at any of those, right? Game out what are some likely and
50:39
plausible scenarios and try to find, you know, a partner for your kids or for
50:44
yourself who is going to be as at home
50:50
and making a living podcasting as they are at milking cows or
50:55
defending your homestead against marauders, right? or dealing with, you know, a
51:02
butler and jihad when you're all fighting the AIS. And that I think helps pe keep people
51:09
grounded because what I worry about at the moment is a lot of people like in Brooklyn or the Bay Area are choosing their mates on the assumption that the
51:16
current service and information-based economy will just continue largely as it
51:22
has. M and at this particular point in history, that seems more unlikely than many other
51:30
possibilities. Yeah, that checks out. That's solid advice. Okay, cool. Jeffrey, thank you
Closing Thoughts and Personal Anecdotes
51:37
so much for coming on base camp. This was really fun. Pleasure. Great to have you on. Great to talk. Hey, our friends
51:43
like it when other friends come on because like there's this weird little social network where everybody knows each other.
51:48
Worlds collide. Yeah. But also, you provided a lot of really good tactical advice that is not stuff that's obvious
51:54
to us. So, this is very useful to I'm thinking differently about the the way we're going to tweak our our propaganda
52:02
and messaging with our children. So, I'm really excited about this. Tweak our propaganda and messaging. I mean, these things are important and
52:09
they're very We don't brainwash our children even a little. Never. That would never happen in our
52:14
house. They they they are crazy. I mean, they they're just as worse. So,
52:19
wait. If we want to end our our our podcast on a fun and and differential note, what are you gonna have for dinner
52:25
tonight? Yeah, Jeffrey, what's for dinner? Oh, God only knows. Um, oh, stuffed
52:31
peppers. I believe my my wife is is making That's pretty fancy shit, man. Stuffed
52:37
peppers. Stuffed red peppers stuffed with They're like corn
52:43
with with cheese and whatever our kids will eat. Yeah. Yeah. We've got eating stuffed peppers. My god. No.
52:50
Yeah. We we we try to feed them pretty well. My kids, this is the thing. My kids will only eat if every ingredient is
52:57
separated from every other ingredient. Yeah. We're like, they've got this whatever like they've got too much Jewish DNA. I
53:03
don't know. But they want everything completely separated and not touching anything else. The idea of putting one
53:10
food inside another food. Oh goodness. Not peppers. That's sacrilege.
53:16
Pretty nice. Red fruits can have seriously negative effects on one's powers. This one curbs magical
53:21
abilities. Are you trying to say you don't like tomatoes? This green squishy area is particularly dangerous. Just look at it. There's
53:29
obviously something diabolical going on. Are they really that bad? Rice has been tainted by its evil.
53:37
[Music] Yeah. Like even if you know they they
53:42
ask for pepperoni pizza, but then they have to remove all the pepperonis because and they're like, "We're gonna remove the pepperoni and we're gonna remove the
53:48
cheese." Yeah. And we're gonna eat every piece individually. Yeah. But no, the exciting plan is for
53:55
our little girl Stella is turning two tomorrow and we're going to take them up to Meow Wolf, which is an amazing
54:01
experience in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Looks super fun. What is Meow Wolf? It's It's hard to explain. I mean, it's
54:08
a it's a semi- psychedelic exploratory experience that is part museum, kind of
54:15
artsy, but partly you just go there and explore it. And MO w
54:22
meow wolf. There's actually several of them in different American cities now. And they're great fun and highly
54:27
recommend it. This is really fun. This is pretty cool. Oh, yeah. No, it's gonna be this. You
54:32
guys do birthdays properly, so Yeah. Birthday. Yeah, it's her birthday. It's
54:38
a good Yeah, it's a good birthday party. Our kids would spur out there too much. They'd be It's like a bad trip for them.
54:44
I just know. Yeah, we don't we don't let our kids out of the house anymore. We better do that.
54:49
We had a Our bigger problem is they busk and they steal. So, we we can't we can't take
54:54
them anymore because it's it's just too dangerous. They barely steal, Simone. Okay. But they lost very aggressively.
55:01
So we can't You told me the story of a kid goes to school, he comes back with a Pokemon card. We go, "How did you get this
55:07
Pokemon card?" And then he tells me, "Well, another kid at school ripped my art." And I was like, "Well, what does
55:13
that have to do with this Pokemon card?" And he and then he goes, "Well, I told him that if he didn't give me his
55:19
Pokemon card, I would tell the teacher." And then we're like, "Oct, that's blackmail. You shouldn't do that." And
55:25
he and he looks at us very sternly and he goes, "There have to be consequences." Yeah. When it comes to propaganda in our
55:31
household, I feel like our children are more heavy on the propaganda than we are. So, but yeah,
55:36
he's like a little little John Wick. Consequences.
55:42
We're so scared. We're so scared. All right. Well, enjoy the stuffed peppers tonight and thank you so much
55:49
for your tactical advice. I'm very excited about this. I'm I'm I'm gonna I'm absolutely going to be recommending Keeper to people because like actual
55:55
traditional matchmakers every time I like suggest people try them out they're like these people are so like
56:01
incompetent and like this actually sounds organized. You want to know like in in the startup
56:06
world it's all about playing a game of arbitrage like where can I you know where can I act tap into this market
56:13
where there's an advantage and it it's clear that like if you want a professional resultsoriented gets things
56:18
done fairly affluent partner like this is where you should go. So get it while
56:24
you can last guys before everyone else hears about it. I'm really excited about that. So yeah, it's it's good to hear of
56:29
one before, you know, our matchmaking network starts to work because we have teenagers reaching out just being like, "Hey, like I'm in college. Like, where
56:35
do I go?" And we're like, "Well, you know, we'd add you to our matchmaking network, but it's all like two to five
56:41
year olds now. It's not really going to be your thing." I mean, maybe if they want to be like, you know, age gap
56:47
relationships in like 10 to 15 years, but not yet. So, what you gonna do? All right. Well, thank you very much, Jeffrey.
