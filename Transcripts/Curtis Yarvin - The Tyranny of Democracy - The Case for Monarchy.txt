Everybody who believes democracy is
great believes either that populism is
great or that meritocracy is great.
>> But they also all of them believe that
either populism is awful or meritocracy
is awful. And so actually just splitting
the word in half into its reality and
not letting it retain this fatal
ambiguity
allows you to basically sort of defeat
each of these things in detail. You
know, here is the problem. You have this
couple who is right about each other.
And as Aristotle said, there's only two
form. Oh, wait. There's a third form of
government which has been used basically
by 98% of regimes for all of history.
Moreover, this third form of governance,
which is monarchy, which is basically
just a description of an or of a
pyramid-shaped org chart, is not only
used by 98% of governments in history,
it is used by all effective
organizations in the world today.
Right, Curtis. Good evening.
>> Hello.
>> Uh, I was in I was in Las Vegas about a
week and a half ago and my good friend I
went for lunch with him and we were I
was bitching about the state of the UK
and he said, "Uh, you need to go and
watch this interview uh Curtis Arvin in
the New York Times. Go and watch it."
So, I went back to the hotel, watched
it.
>> And had you heard of me before vaguely?
Maybe. I heard the name and I think I'd
seen you cuz of the Constantine show,
but like I hadn't engaged with it cuz I
hadn't known anything about you. But
when I was talking about what's going on
in the UK, he was like, "Just go and
watch this New York Times interview.
It's brilliant." And I did. Then I
watched the Tucker one and then I think
I watched
>> which is much older.
>> Which is Yeah. much older. Um but I I
think I watched I basically spent about
24 hours watching everything.
>> Jesus Christ.
>> Reached out to my guy Joe. Uh and you
were in the UK.
>> I was.
>> So I missed you there and then he said
you were in New York. cuz I said to
Connor, "We got to fly out. We got to do
this." I wanted to talk to you. And I
tell you why. The reason, well, there's
loads of questions I've got. But, uh,
one of the main reasons I wanted to talk
to you is because I kind of came to this
realization that I think we've lived in
this world, tell me if I'm wrong here,
>> that as long as I've lived, things have
always been kind of the same.
>> So, we kind of expect it to always be
the same,
>> always be the same.
>> But there is a reality that revolutions
happen, things change.
And we should at least discuss that.
>> And the more stagnant they are, the more
suddenly they seem to change. And one
way, you know, I was just up at Yale. I
did a Yale political union event and a
Federalist Society event, but things
which would have been utterly
unthinkable a year ago, not even
especially two years ago, where I did
come to Yale two years ago, but it was
like I had to sneak in, you know. Um,
and
the way I was expressing this, um, you
know, in my YPU speech was that of
course the obvious comparison is to the
Soviet Union, but the thing about
discarding the Soviet Union was that not
only did you have to discard these
leaders, not only did you have to
discard this government, not only did
you have to discard this system of
government, but you had to discard the
whole theory of government. and even to
some extent a theory of man in order to
be rid of the Soviet Union. And one of
the things you notice about that problem
is you notice this sort of curious
effect where big things are easier than
small things. So actually everybody in
the mid80s was thinking about how do we
reform the Soviet Union? How do we fix
this? The grain harvest, comrade, it's
too low. You know, our transistors are
just fat. They're just fat transistors.
They're just no good. Right? we get
these calculators from from, you know,
West Germany and they're incredible. How
do they make these things, right? You
know, and you just have this feeling
that you're losing and you can sort of
see like lose all around you and you
sort of want to push back against the
lose, but you want to repair the fabric
of the system and you don't see no
actually at a certain point that was
probably a long time ago, it's become
much easier to replace it than repair
it. But the thing is when we're thinking
about
the age of these political ideas in the
Soviet Union, they only had to throw out
about 80 years of political history. In
other words, basically the entire I mean
in the fall of the Soviet Union, there
were still people that remembered
Zarism, right? You know, and I think the
equivalent period for our system of
government is actually about 400 years.
So, it's a bigger lift. And moreover,
it's also a much bigger lift because the
Soviets could or thought they could just
revert to the western system of
government. It was very few people that
said like Soulja Nitsson said, "Hey, no,
not so fast. You can't just flip over to
the western system because maybe the
western system isn't perfect either, you
know." And nobody really heard that. He
made this famous speech at Harvard in
1978 where he says this and people are
like, "What the hell? I thought you were
supposed to be for like freedom, man."
you know, and um and and so actually
like that flip over,
you know, that flip over involves
basically we don't even they thought at
least thought they had a model to go off
of.
>> We don't have a living model to go off
of at all. We don't have anything,
right? We don't have anything except,
you know, huge piles of books written by
dead people. That's basically what we
have. huge piles of books written by
dead people and some great technology
and those are sort of our ingredients
but I'm entirely convinced that you know
that is the magnitude of change needed
to you know to change the way we think
about the way we govern ourselves in a
way that will basically and the acid
test for that is how can the west leap
ahead of China
>> and and is it for you is that it's not
that democracy has historically failed.
It's just failing now because we've had
such massive changes in technology,
wealth, socialility.
>> No, no, no, no. It was always a bad
idea, you know, and well, I mean, the
word democracy was considered, you know,
it was a slur up until really the 19th
century, right? You know, like you start
to, you know, John Adams will tell you
that democracy is the worst system of
government ever, right? um you know his
second cousin Samuel Adams might might
have praised it but he might also have
just dodged the word um because it had
such a bad name. You know, if you go to
the page on Athenian democracy, the
Wikipedia page, the last time I looked,
um I'm sure these things change all the
time, but there's a quote um um about
Athenian democracy from a modern
scholar, and modern scholars are not, I
think, generally that good on the
subject, but you know, he's like, you
know, it's sort of stunning that
actually people have spent the last
almost last 2500 years trying to lar
this form of government when every
writing extant writing we have from the
period says that it was absolutely
horrible and led to the fall of Athens,
right? You know, I mean, and executed
Socrates, right? And so you're like, the
question of why people keep being
attracted to this starts to be a little
like the question of why people why rats
keep being attracted to cocaine. Maybe
the cocaine isn't actually so good for
the rats after all, right? You know, and
and like can we can we think that? Can
we suspect it? because you know Xenapon
certainly thought it uh you know and and
the
Plato I mean certainly thought it um
Socrates probably thought it as you know
the hemlock did whatever horrible thing
it does to you uh you know yeah so first
of all you have this word democracy and
when I was debating professor Ruben
Rubenfeld at the YPU the other day I
grew there was not it's like
counterveailing speeches and not enough
really back and forth is kind of my
criticism of the format so I got a
minute as a general rebuttal and one of
the things after hearing a lot of voices
including student voices on the subject
I was like what I'm really convinced
needs to be abolished is actually the
word democracy because the word is
extremely meritricious we can start by
not using the word actually make a
practice of basically not using uh you
know the language of the jargon of the
regime or you know what you might call
the tongue of Mordor like you know
somebody uses a word that starts with if
and ends in ursy in my presence I grow I
kind of give them a look right you know
I'm like you could have said variety
you're really entirely capable of saying
variety in this situation you know um
there will be a time when it is
appropriate to say this word but not
here not now right and that's because
you're sort of you're you're you're
invoking power when you use these words
the word democracy means legitimate
blessed government right how democratic
is a government is how blessed is And
one of the sort of the easy kind of
brain twisters which you can sort of use
to unwrap your brain from this a little
bit is notice that the words democracy
and politics have opposite veilance. So
calling anything democratic is a
compliment. Calling it political is an
insult. Um and I was talking to a
professor the other day. He even started
talking very seriously about the idea
that we need democracy without
elections. You know, most people will
say, "Well, I love democracy, but you
know, uh, does it really have to mean
putting politicians in charge of the
government?"
>> The humble bee, a keystone species
crucial to the survival of Earth's
inhabitants.
Here's how things would look if bees
vanished.
And here's how they'd look if humans
vanished.
But imagine if instead we became a
keystone species by doing things the
right way, by taking responsibility for
our actions and becoming the solution.
Iron Mines, the world's most responsible
currency the right way
because the future depends on it.
Well, that's good. Like I've been
recently arguing with a lot of people
locally where I live and the question I
keep putting to everyone is like name me
one thing that's got better under the
government in the last 20 years and
there's never an answer.
>> No. And and moreover, there's never an
answer. And you were also distracted by
the cape rather than the matador in a
way because actually as you probably
know you know you know yes minister the
thick of it that you know that great
tradition of um
>> you know very accurate even even when I
was growing up as a child of the
American deep state you know I knew
about yes minister because it was
actually the only thing that sort of tr
told the truth about my parents' world
in a very comic you know sort of way
right and the reality is that Sir
Humphrey Applebee is really in charge of
everything and the importance of
Parliament or the Prime Minister or Jim
Hacker MP or even Jim Hacker PM to Sir
Humphrey Applebee is in a way comparable
to the importance of Charles III right
you have a fundamentally ceremonial form
of government and so what you're looking
at is a system which is different from
the USSR but not as different as you
might think moreover the level of
historical connections is extremely deep
and intriguing. For example, did you
know about your prime minister's summer
vacation?
>> No.
>> In Czechoslovakia?
>> I didn't know about that.
>> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Uh, you know, Kirst as
a teenager was basically uh, you know,
spent a summer in a program behind the
iron curtain. Now, maybe he did
>> Fabian.
>> Yes, we know.
Fabians. We know.
>> Did I mention that we know? You know, do
you know their original logo of the
Fabian Society?
>> No.
>> It is literally I don't imagine how they
did this. You can look this up. You will
not believe me. This sounds like a BS
internet myth. It is absolutely true. It
is literally a wolf in sheep's clothing.
>> Conor, you got to find that for me.
>> Bring it up.
>> You got to find that. So, he was
probably crying during the Velvet
Revolution. Oh [ __ ] It is.
>> Bring that one up the top left. Oh,
yeah. Holy [ __ ]
>> Holy, you know. So, so right, you know,
>> so actually we're dealing with a wolf
here, uh, you know, and like all of this
sheep stuff and you know, when the wolf
in sheep's clothing addresses you is,
"Will you not be kind and gentle, fellow
sheep?" You know, um, you know, that's
not really uh you you just you want to
be a dog and not a sheep basically. Um,
>> so is it is democracy really there to
allow the slide into socialism?
Democracy again if we stop if we stop
using this word yeah
>> we will immediately feel much better. So
let me explain how to stop using this
word.
>> Okay there are in fact two things very
you know discreet and understandable
things that we know by common names for
which we use the word democracy
interchangeably. These two things are at
war with each other. So it's as if we
use the same word for elves and orcs or
something. Right? As soon as you
disamiguate this very slippery word
democracy, you can split it into two
things in contemporary political
language that will immediately be
understood. When you ever you tempted to
say democracy, say either populism,
which is a somewhat slippery word, but
we'll sort of get back to that and roll
it up, or meritocracy.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. So, you know, having one word for
populism and meritocracy allows Soros
World to basically, you know, go around
the continent claiming that he's for
democracy when actually he believes that
politicians should have no power at all.
Right? And and you know, this is not a
new phenomenon. This is a this is a
centurylong phenomenon. And what happens
even before communism in the sort of
Fabian period broadly which is the late
um you know late of course 19th century
you know the way I I like to basically
really get inside the head of a
tradition is go back in time far enough
where I actually like it. So basically
my my personal guru is a an English
writer named a Scottish writer named
Thomas Carlilele.
>> Okay. um who I recently learned actually
I think he's pronounced Carlilele which
is very weird to me but I'll just keep
saying Carlile.
>> There's a town in the north of England
called Carla.
>> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And and um
absolutely fabulous writer and even
though I think the his work that I like
the most is actually some of his least
read work. But the
John Ruskin whose name you might you
know recognize is a student of Cariles
>> and the Ruskinites sparked this sort of
you know Ruskin is basically an
influencer right as is Carlilele in his
own way. Ruskin is really an influencer
and so there's this like late 19th
century cult of Ruskin and the
Ruskinites um you might recognize kind
of the arts and crafts movement is
related like art nuvo but also the
Fabians come out of the Ruskinites. So,
in America, there's a group called the
liberal Republicans, also known as the
Mugwamps, some of my favorite writers.
Um, Henry Adams, might recognize the
name. Charles Francis Adams Jr.,
probably don't recognize the name, his
brother, even better. Brooks Adams,
amazing. Brooks Adams, total critic of
democracy. He writes this like, so Henry
Adams wrote a novel called Democracy,
which is really about how awful politics
is. Published it anonymously because
that was the times. Um, you know, Henry
at Brooks Adams wrote the law of
civilization and decay, which is this
kind of spinarian rant. Bear in mind,
these people are all great grandsons of
John Adams, right? They're and grandsons
of John Quincy Adams. This is the great
these are great American hereditary
aristocrats. It's like the freaking
Kennedys. Like, so like imagine like if
like, you know, the editor of the New
Yorker is also, you know, a member of
the Kennedy family, right? You know, so
this is like intense like aristocracy,
concentrated superpower aristocracy.
These people basically look at politics
and what we now call the guilded age.
They would have said the great barbecue.
And I'm going to confine this to the
sort of the American side. There's a
parallel English side. These people look
at American politics in this period.
they see that is disgusting and corrupt
and basically creates things like sort
of so Lincoln is sort of this
revolutionary figure and Thaddius
Stevens who follows him is still more re
Thadd that Stevens is never president
he's leading the country from out of the
Senate this is the period of radical
reconstruction just insane piece of the
20th century that dropped into the 19th
imposes basically third world government
in the American south people are like oh
my god you know like you know they'd
never seen the third world before but
they saw it you
And um you know that basically retreats
as revolutions do and comes into sort of
the guilded age where if you drive
around New York basically everything
cool was sort of built in this between
like you know 1850 and 1950 basically.
Um and you know they look at the you
know the way they're governed under
literal democracy. Literal democracy
meaning populism meaning politicians are
in charge of the government. So literal
democracy, politicians are in charge of
the government. And what do they do?
They're idiots. They steal. They run
political machines. They're boss tweed.
You've probably heard the name boss
tweeted. So what you basically get, you
know, here's this beautiful mechanism
that John Lock is fantasizing about or
whatever. And what you actually get, you
know, is a bunch of Irish men electing
boss tweed.
They were a little bigoted, let's face
it, you know, like they they had a very
like, you know, the level of racism you
need to despise, you know, the Orish is
like a very high level of racism that
isn't really available today, right? So,
these are bigoted people. Um, and
they're, you know, profoundly
aristocratic, prejudiced in any every
way. They consider themselves absolutely
superior to everyone in the world except
maybe certain people in London. And
they're probably right about all of
these things. And they're like, "This is
a [ __ ] show." And so they're basically
like, you know what we're going to do?
We are going to relearn the lesson of
Plato
and we are become going to become a new
guardian class and we feel ourselves to
be entirely capable and righteous and
ready to rule. We know how this is done.
We know it's not boss tweed. There's a
coming world of science. We're going to
rule scientifically and it's going to be
amazing, right? And again, this is
before this is turn of the century
stuff. And into that comes also there
there so there's a sort of statesmanlike
energy. And then there's this like
religious missionary like mainline
Protestant missionary world that um you
know wants basically feels the same
sense of aristocracy but also believes
that it can literally turn everyone in
the world into the same kind of
aristocrat. And we have adopted that
wholly unfounded
actually objective scientific belief is
woven very very deeply into the basis of
our culture and there's no evidence for
it whatsoever. Um and so you know this
is their kind of um that is one strain
in it and that strain sort of grows the
strongest over time until it you know
basically leads to where we are. But of
course, you know, there's this
aristocratic strain uh you know, and
really the first generation of American
progressives, these are progressives
with like a capital P. Progressive has
been a euphemism for communist since
roughly, you know, 1930. Uh my
grandfathers were communist. They use
that euphemism. That's normal, right? Um
communist actually means you're a member
of the party. Progressive means you're a
supporter of the party. While there was
a party, there's no longer really a
party. But that's just like cancer going
from like a centralized mass to a
decentralized mass. Uh you know so in
any case that's the backstory basically
is that aristocrats were like you know
what literal democracy populism is not
working. So we need to invent basically
this platonic oligarchy which we're
going to call democracy because for the
same reason that the United Kingdom is
still called a kingdom. Although frankly
it's not
>> sad.
>> Yeah,
>> we're sad.
>> Yeah. Um and and the the um it is sad.
And the
I was just reading Blackstone on the
laws of the king. Maybe more about that
later. But um the the in any case this
these platonic aristocrats basically
were like all right we are going to
govern in a statesmanlike way but we are
going to be the first ever to bring
science into statesmanship. Thus was
born the world of social science. This
idea that we can be governed by numbers
and formulas um you know uh and you know
things concepts like even like GDP or
even the way we measure inflation. These
are wholly 20th century concepts. they
were introduced in an absolutely
thriving America and um just obviously
thriving America. You've seen pictures
of the streets in the 20s, even the 30s,
you know, and I'm just like, you know,
if this was the and you came to if this
was where the rule you followed brought
you of what you use was the rule, right?
you know, they have all of this social
science, all of this kind of scientific
and basically pseudocientific,
you know, intellect that's put together
in mimicry of the obvious triumphs of
actual science. And of course, this is
done on both sides of the iron curtain.
It is not, you know, like I mean, the
Soviets are only minor deviation from
this. Basically, they're really part of
the same phenomenon. And the the
and it was thought basically and you
find again if you go farther back you
find this thought most clearly that
these platonic guardians these Fabians
these professors etc etc etc you know
they're living the pure life of the mind
in their ivory towers. You've heard of
the marketplace of ideas. They're
buying, they're selling, they're in the
marketplace of ideas, right? It's all
good, right? and and and you know and in
the marketplace of ideas the best idea
is triumph right you know like truth
will always defeat defeat fiction. Well
here is the problem this is the
fundamental flaw with this design
because they seem to have solved the
problem of who watches the watchd dogs
forever and ever perfectly. And what
they were going to do is they were going
to take the disgusting sewer of Gilded
Age politics and they had identified
this pure clean glacial lake and they
were just going to open the drain in the
lake and let the lake rush into the
sewer and just clean it out with, you
know, 50,000 lbs of, you know, pressure
per square inch. All this disgusting
stuff would be removed. And it was an
absolutely wild idea, as wild as any of
my ideas today, that like professors
would be running the country in like
1900, right? And they had this wild
visionary, brilliant idea because they
knew that they were capable of ruling
and they knew that there were like they
had 30 IQ points, 50 IQ points, I don't
know, boss Tweed, right? you know, guy
probably doesn't even read, you know,
he's like his mark. He sounds like his
mark. I don't know, you know, and like
the the um so it seemed like a real
no-brainer to them. And they forgot only
one thing. There was only one technical
one small technical error that doomed
this utopia, which is that there wasn't
a valve in the pipe. And so water flows
downhill, but ideas are not really like
that. And especially what really loves
to flow uphill is power. And so they
thought that if they put the world of
ideas in control of power and the world
of ideas which was pure in which
basically the best idea would win. You
know here's a wonderful demonstration of
this. I got something that everybody
every intellectual should own which is a
Victorian encyclopedia. I honestly do
not know how they did encyclopedias with
Victorian technology. This is Chambers
encyclopedia from the 1870s. How how do
you do an encyclopedia without
computers? I don't know. You know,
that's like saying how do you like
record music like before electricity,
right? I have no idea, right? You know,
and and yet they kind of managed, you
know, and and the um
and and this is 12 volume encycl very
very full interesting encyclopedia
really this beautiful picture of the
past, right? And then because it's
actually hard to update an encyclopedia
without computers, right? you know, they
would do, you know, the 12th edition
would be like the 11th edition. I
actually I also have a 12th edition
Britannica which also does this. The
1911 Britannica is really the great one.
Um, and but you the 12th edition is much
cheaper and just has some supplemental
volumes. Uh, the 1911 Britannica is like
Wikipedia if every entry was written and
edited by leading scholars in the field.
Um, and
whose names are actually like visible
there. It's an incredible document. And
the um in any case I'm reading the
supplement on like chemistry and the
supplement on chemistry is usually like
3 or 4 years later is like you know
we've been thinking a lot about
chemistry and we've decided that uh you
know it's no longer right you know we
were writing water as HO but really it
is correct to rate it as H2O and they're
just like oh yeah we just fix that right
you know today if there would be like
this like lifelong generational struggle
between the HO people and the H2O people
and the HO people would know that if
they lost that struggle they would lose
their jobs, their careers, their
livelihood, probably their wives, right?
You know, and like you know, they would
not give up, you know, they would they
would fight tooth and nail for Ho. Like
Ho would be absolutely stuck. That's the
way that 21st century science works.
Victorian science which created this
godd without without which we have no
they're like, "Oh yeah, it's H it's H2O,
right?" You know, that's the way it's
supposed to work, right? You know, and
but the way it actually works in this
system now that you've taken this
beautiful life of the mind with the
academics like dancing around the fairy
groves and the robes and and toning and
having symposiums, right? Which is
clearly the way it's supposed to be is
um that that now everything because
basically power matters, everything is a
bureaucracy. Everything has the
structure and even worse the ideas
there's a conflict of interest. The
ideas that prevail are no longer the
best ideas
because actually there's another you
know evol evolution you know the
marketplace of ideas is based on
evolution. And evolution is the survival
of the fittest. It's not the survival of
the best. It's not the survival of the
smartest. It's the survival of the
fittest.
Evolution can make you dumber as well as
smarter, stronger as weaker as well as
stronger, smaller as well as bigger.
There is no like trend line in
evolution, right? And um
the
what happens when you basically connect,
you know, the beautiful blue lake of
ideas without any valve whatsoever to
the, you know, incredible sewer of power
is power just comes rushing back up the
pipe because power wants to flow uphill
and just huge bubbles of sewage start
appearing in your beautiful alpine lake.
Uh we call this sewage communism
basically. I mean there's a number of
words for it but um communism is a good
one. Um and the but it's not a specific
set of ideas. It's a way that ideas
evolve in this context. And the way that
ideas evolve is suddenly you know it's
not survival of the truest anymore. It's
survival of the most relevant because
actually suddenly the quest in academia
becomes the quest for funding and the
quest for power and the quest for
relevance because actually because your
ideas can control government policy
directly right impact really matters
like you know when you're in this ivory
tower you want to be doing something
that is relevant to power and I think
there's no better illustration of this
and this was the illustration I used at
you much uh much more quickly. I'm sadly
at at YPU the other day at Yale. I was
basically like let's think about
vyology.
Now the thing is when we think about
viology, I think we can all agree that
viology is a public good because
actually defending our species or the
whole species really against viruses is
not unlike defending the earth against
asteroids or aliens. You've heard of
this alien spaceship that's going to
come kill us in a couple months
probably. Three Atlas.
>> Probably not, but you never know. Um and
and it could render a lot of this stuff,
frankly, pretty irrelevant, but let's
keep on, you know, like, you know, and
and the the um probably not. And it's
probably just academic puffery. Um I
suspect it's a big comment, but um it's
a really big it's a really big com. I
suspect it's just a comment. And also
the nickel and the tail is in the wrong
direction. It's probably just become
>> Is this this long fin thing?
>> Uh yeah, but that's just because the
exposure is stretched so it looks like a
cylinder. Of course, it doesn't mean
it's not a cylinder. Uh the tail is also
pointing in the wrong direction as
though it was like a deceleration jet. I
It's probably nothing. I wouldn't worry.
I wouldn't worry. Um don't worry. Um and
uh
again, there's no way there's no way it
would help. You know, anyway anyway
anyway off of aliens off of aliens. Um,
you know, what happens in viology is a
nice case in point because the nominal
goal of viology
is to defend us from viruses. Yes. So,
if you have no conflicts of interest, if
you're working in a system entirely
without conflicts of interest, then you
will be striving every day to defend
humanity from viruses. You will not be
striving every day to infect humanity
with viruses. And the idea that you
would infect humanity with viruses will
be very atrocious to you. Um and and yet
somehow we did
>> conceivably actually you know the issue
with co isn't so much you know I don't
think anyone has a really serious case
that it was intentional. I think we're
looking at secondderee murder here at
most which is a pretty minor crime. On
the other hand 20 million people is kind
of a lot of them were old. They were
going to die anyway. So negligence.
>> Yeah, negligence, but like kind of big-
time negligence. And also the behavior
after the negligence really should have
been, oh my god, we screwed up. Here's
the Wuhan virus database. Where's the
Wuhan virus database? Here's the we
totally screwed up. We own it. You know,
I am personally going to like shave my
head and retire to a monastery. I did
not mean to kill 20 million people, but
I did. That's how it went down.
>> That is not how we saw them behave.
>> And there was money to be made.
Yes, but the money is the least
important thing. I'm I'm less wor I'm
more worried about how this happened and
why this happened. And I would first
point out that it is entirely possible.
Let's give the uh the wet market people
their due. It's entirely possible that
as John Stewart put it, you know, a bat
met a panggalan and they fell in love.
Um and it
>> if you've seen the John Stewart episode,
like two minutes of John Stewart, my
god, the man is a genius. I don't know
who wrote that for him. They wrote it
perfectly. He delivers it perfectly and
I'm like, I will put I will forget the
rest of John Stewart's entire career for
that one clip. Okay, I'll just forget
it. I I'll pretend it didn't happen, you
know? And the
but maybe it was a coincidence, but even
if it was a coincidence, in their
private Slack messages, some of these
viologists basically looked at this
grant and was like, "Wow, this looks
like a recipe for CO." So, they made a
recipe for CO and they were cooking it.
Maybe the recipe didn't turn out and CO
just happened independently because a
bat met a pengalin in Wuhan where there
are no bats. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You
know, right. It's possible. It's
possible. But the real issue is
basically in terms of government policy
is the cost benefit of this work from
the perspective of the nominal interest
of viology because the idea that um
actually there's been there's no benefit
whatsoever has been demonstrated for
this gain of function work. Actually
people just kind of wave their hands and
say well science is good, knowledge is
good. Wasn't that the motto of uh in in
Animal House? Uh yeah, science is good.
Trust us, science is good. More money,
please. Trust the science. More money,
please. Right? You know, and that's the
way Echoh Health Alliance was
essentially going about its work like
and there's an interesting story
actually behind Echohalth Alliance. If I
can diverge for a second and just, you
know, just as a way of illustrating the
like absolutely diabolical effects of of
eliminating that valve between the life
of the mind and power. Are you familiar
with the named Jerren Gerald Durl?
>> No.
>> Uh Lawrence Durl?
>> No.
>> Lawrence Durl was a famous author of the
early 20th century. He wrote the
Alexandria Quartet uh and other famous
literary works. His brother Gerald Durl,
whose books I read a ton of as a kid
because I grew up in like a Commonwealth
countries where Gerald Durl was
everywhere, was a zoologologist.
And he was the most engaging essay
essaisted. He went to basically various
decaying corners of the soon-to-be
defunct British Empire and collected
cute fuzzy animals and brought them home
to a zoo that he established in Jersey.
Not New Jersey, but Jersey. um and
lovely lovely writer, delicious
experiences, kids love animals, etc.,
etc., etc. and this business of
collecting there's a you know a show
that was huge in the US uh you know the
Durl family something something
something um you know based on his life
in Corfu as a child beautiful romantic
so Durl basically of course we live in
the era of what you call I believe the
quango we call it the NGO and he found a
quango and the purpose of his quango is
to go and collect little fuzzy animals
and breed them and like restore and save
the species from the like disastrous
collapse of Africa or whatever, right?
Which he never, of course, mentions.
He's not political. And um this is all
very good and true. And he funds this
alliance called the wildlife trust,
which goes, maybe you can see where I'm
going with this, pay me dot, which goes
to um you know, and goes and collects
wildlife. And of course, he grows old
and passes away. And he is replaced as
the leader of the wildlife trust by his
successor, also uh an ecologist, a man
named Peter Dazzac.
And Peter Dazzac realizes that the
purpose of an NGO is not to actually
collect cute funny, you know, uh, monkey
babies,
>> collect money,
>> but to get grants. And he's like,
actually, you know, the thing about
spider monkeys or whatever is they're
not relevant, but you know what's
relevant?
>> Viruses.
And so the Wildlife Trust becomes Echo
Health Alliance, and they start to get
like Pentagon grants for hunting
viruses. And this really kicks into high
gear of course after SARS 1 because SARS
1 is a real wet market escape. Um and so
everyone this is why the where the wet
market came from. It's just what
everyone was looking for. it's you know
um ascertainment bias and um and so this
creates basically echoalth alliance
which basically goes to the bat caves in
southern China and Eunan and is like how
can we find more of these bat corona
viruses to establish that they could be
a threat to humanity because actually
actually if they're a threat to humanity
we should study them because they're a
threat to humanity. Now, the problem
with these bat viruses is they're
actually bat viruses. Actually, each bat
is infected with like several corona
viruses. So, so like there's a whole lot
of corona viruses. Most of them you
could like snort them, you know, in pure
powder and they do absolutely nothing
because they're bad viruses. But, but
sometimes they mutate and the mutation
is a random thing. You know, it's a
cosmic ray comes out of space, alters,
changes a G to an A or something. You
know, how how can we predict that that's
going to happen? That was the name of
one of these studies, predict. Well, one
way to predict that that that that could
possibly happen is to mutate them
ourselves.
How could they possibly mutate? And it's
like you find your like, you know, a
10-year-old son, you know, um you come
home and your 10-year-old son is setting
fire, you know, to the kitchen curtains
and you're like, Kevin, what are you
doing? And he's like, "Science."
>> And you're like, "Science is like, well,
you know, science says that uh over 40%
of house fires start in the kitchen.
What if the curtains caught fire? Could
we get out? Could the dog could the dog
get out? You know, and that's that's
when you realize that you have a
problem, right? You know, we have a
problem like that. We have to talk about
Kevin, you know, and
you know, Kevin has a name and his name
is Peter Dazzac and Peter Dazzac has
actually shut down Echo Health Alliance
and founded a new organization under a
different name,
>> right? And which is now, you know, going
out and getting grants. Actually, you
know, the importance of corona virus has
only been proven by these events. There
are more virus hunters than ever.
Moreover, you know, if you think, well,
Trump will save us from this. Well, all
right. So, I forget his name
unfortunately, but you know, Fouchi is
out. Yeah.
>> You know, Fouchy had a somewhat
checkered record with AIDS as well as
you might as you might recall.
>> Got away with it, though.
>> He know the amazing, you know, genius.
There's a kind of Morardi level criminal
genius of not only inventing this thing
but actually successfully covering it
up. Yeah.
>> I mean, oh my god. Right. You know, and
and like what a genius, right? And the
uh
>> you have to, you know, salute him in the
same way that you know, you're just
like, you know, wow, how does Ted Bundy
do all those things or like Hitler
amazing graphic design, right? You know,
Fouchy, right? you know, amazing
bureaucrat, master of bureaucracy,
emperor of viology for 30 years, you
know, the Robert Moses of viology. There
will never be anyone like him, you know,
and but he's replaced by all right and
they're working on actually shutting
down gain of function research. They are
working on this. They are trying um
they're seriously trying uh you know,
unfortunately the person that they
replaced and and I I don't think they're
funding any more coronavirus research.
Uh and the fellow who replaced Fauci
actually god Eikleberger something like
that as the chief of viology is also a
great viologist who made his who showed
his greatness. You know most a lot of
scientists have this like one great idea
that makes their name right and his
great idea was what if holy cow he was
in the bath he was in the shower one day
and it came to him we could resurrect
the 1918 flu.
Absolutely. You think I'm [ __ ]
joking. I'm not [ __ ] joking. And he's
like, "I know what we'll do in Alaska.
We'll go to Alaska." I swear to God, I'm
not making this up. We will go to Alaska
and in the perafrost in Alaska.
>> Sounds like there must
>> there must be bodies of people who died
from the 1918 flu. We can exume the
bodies. We can dig them up. We can
restore the virus and we can study it.
And he literally did exactly this and it
made his freaking career. And that is
who is running viology today, right? So,
you know, basically you're like,
you know, the famous New Yorker cartoon
of like the audience is like, you know,
what do these dumb pilots know about
flying? You know, let's elect the
captain, you know, that's literal
democracy.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Here we have meritocracy,
right? And the thing is you know and and
if you generalize across what happened
here what you see is that basically
you've by saying you know defining the
way viology is funded according to the
impact of the science you've
inadvertently you've inadvertently
created there's this famous effect that
happened in the Raj in India the cobra
problem where you know the Raj was like
well too many people are being bitten by
snakes we need to stamp out cobras let's
bring Um, how about a bounty for every
cobra head you bring in? So, you know,
what did the Indians do? You can guess.
They started farming cobras, right? You
know, and so viology has turned into
viology, this unimportant, this small
part of, you know, we viology is good,
but honestly, we haven't really solved
viruses. We could probably do without
it. Viology has turned into this massive
cobra farm that killed 20 million
people. And then I'm like, do you
suppose this affects other aspects of
government as well? And I'm like, wow,
you know, we had this policy of uh
expanding NATO to the east. Nobody could
figure out why we wanted to expand NATO
to the east. We had to expand NATO to
the east. Like any addict, we kept
promising the Russians we would not
expand NATO to the east. And then we
expanded NATO to the east. Right? And
why you know many experts there are
actually the people who should be
running vyology today people like
Richard Ebrite just name names Richard
Ebrite people are warned against not
only of gain of function research but
these specific corona virus experiments
like if there were a marketplace of
ideas that worked like these guys would
never like they would be entitled by law
to three [ __ ] a day I don't know
something you know it was just like like
the people who weren't against co and
were not listened to like the idea that
these people have not been granted even
by the Trump administration simply the
right to fire anyone they like and
basically recommend anyone they like for
prosecution that would be their
appropriate way to handle this right you
know in a system that was actually as
self-correcting as we think this system
is but it does not appear to be very
self-correcting does it you know and so
that's meritocracy
meritocracy has basically said we are
going to evolve all of the ideas in this
marketplace of ideas to be as powerful
as possible.
>> But it's not a real marketplace.
>> Well, it is a real marketplace. It's
just a marketplace that's rewarding
things that you and I don't happen to
really like. It is a real marketplace,
>> but but it's a marketplace financed by
uh an infinite money printer.
>> Uh well, there's that. There's that
certainly, but it is actually supported
even more so. I mean, it's sort of part
of the state in that sense. The infinite
money printer is a problem. We should
get to that. We should get to that. But
even if this system was running on hard
money, it would still have a very
serious problem.
>> Yeah. But it's where the hard money
comes from.
>> I want to talk to you about one of my
sponsors, Incogn. And that means we're
going to talk about the weird world of
spam. And I don't just mean those spam
emails that you get day after day from
companies you never heard of and
companies you've never signed up to. I'm
also talking about those spam phone
calls you get from those people who seem
to know a little bit too much about you
trying to get your bank details. It's
all a bit creepy. Right now, this all
comes from the world of data brokerage.
There are companies out there collecting
your data, building profiles, and
sending that data to anyone who wants
it. Which is why when one of those
scammers phones you up, they seem to
know everything about you. Now, I've
tried I've tried myself to get off these
lists. Try to get off the phone list.
Try to get off the email list. I
unsubscribe from every one of these
emails that comes in. But this game of
whack-a-ole, it just never ends. And so
this is where Incogn comes in. They do
all the hard work for you. They reach
out to these companies and they will get
you legally removed from these lists.
And I know because the last time they
sponsored my show, I signed up and I
didn't take the free option that they
offered me. I wanted to pay for it. I
wanted to see if you get value for
money. And they removed me from 79 data
broker lists. And so I've stayed on.
I've stayed a subscriber. and I have
seen a massive decrease in the number of
emails and phone calls I've been
getting. So, it's a great service. I
recommend you check it out. If you're
sick of this like I was, please head
over to incogn.com/peter
and sign up. If you use the code peter,
you will get a lovely 60% discount. So,
that's incogn.com/
peter.
>> It's like it's like it's like your
analogy with Apple. Apple Apple would
only focus on
>> so so so let me let me rephrase what
you're saying in a way. When you're
running a government on soft money,
>> yeah,
>> you have lost a source of
self-correction that is very powerful.
You have lost the corrective effect of
reality because
you are actually able to borrow
infinitely.
And because you were able to borrow
infinitely, especially if you have the
global reserve currency because your
great-grandparents conquered the world,
okay, you
go
>> uh you know, you basically have um you
have a spectacularly unaccountable state
and your spectacularly unaccountable
state is basically free of any of real
like constraints on the bizarre pseudo
evolution of this marketplace of ideas.
So it can go almost infinitely crazy
>> but it but its goal also is
self-preservation.
So its goal is to direct the funding
towards the things that helps preserve
it and convince people.
>> Well the thing is that you don't want to
like it's a purely decentralized
mechanism and that's what makes it so
powerful. So when people, you know, when
we when we sort of think in the way of
this sort of kind of 400year-old way of
thinking, we have this sort of
anti-autocratic way of thinking, we're
always looking for conspiracies and
powers. Actually, what makes
progressivism so powerful and so
dangerous
is that it's genuinely a spontaneous
order. It actually doesn't have a
center. It doesn't need a center. It
doesn't push. It pulls. Or rather, it
doesn't push. It sucks, right? And so
actually like what you see in this
marketplace of ideas is the temptation
of power.
>> And if you remove it's not the pressure
of censorship, it's the temptation, it's
the seduction by which the most sexy
ideas are the most powerful ideas. You
know, fast forward to the present, you
know, what is sexy? How can like
watching like, you know, the new PT
Anderson movie, which you know, I was
reviewing just the other day for the
spectator. How can the new PT Anderson
movie make like ' 60s violence, you
know, in the 21st century seem sexy?
It's almost impossible. I don't think it
succeeds. But the fact that you can even
try to make, you know, communism feel
sexy today is incredible. like and that
basically speaks to a fundamental
sexiness of the idea of the thing which
keeps recurring despite the evidence as
I was saying earlier about Athenian
democracy that it really just doesn't
work and so everything at every level is
sort of seduced by power and many of the
tropes and and this is one of the
reasons for sort of the huge failures
of basically libertarianism because I'm
you know I've literally read I think
everything that Mises and Ruff Bard
wrote, "I'm definitely a recovering
libertarian." Uh, you know, I've had
every flavor of this whiskey. uh and um
you know libertarian sort of keeps
failing and this is in a way related to
its leftist origins because
libertarianism 200 years ago was
classical liberalism and it was on the
left
>> and and you know understanding that the
fact that it was on the left sort of
means that it's kind of it has a kind of
flaw in a sense basically is what pushed
me. This is a good example of why it's
not just sufficient to wind the clock
back to like 1965 or 1940 or or some
other period. You know, even to wind the
clock back to 1776 is a mistake because
the American Revolution is fundamentally
leftist. And all of these leftist tropes
sort of seep in a mythical way into, for
example, American conservatism and kind
of fatally poison it because it's trying
to fight leftism with leftism. Um
actually the nature of this leftism is
the sense in which sort of all ideas are
kind of corrupted in a way that makes
these kind of malignant ideas seem more
powerful. So for example in France in
the 1770s
big American craze big angophilia people
are like wow the American Revolution
that's freaking cool that's punk. You
know Lafayette goes over to fight in the
revolution. Like how punk is that? Like
that's seriously punk right? You know,
everyone cool was into these new English
ideas of like democracy and elections
and constitutional at the very least
constitutional monarchy. And you know
who got infected with this like you know
co of the mind is Louis the 16th
himself. The revolution as they say was
first in the mind of the king. You know
Louis the 16th was like wow this like
constitutional democracy seems to work
really well in England. Actually, the
kings have had their power removed
basically since, you know, for almost a
hundred years at this time. But he's
like, he just wants to tinker with those
little locks. He's just kind of a nerd,
right? And he's like, "Oh, yeah, pretty
cool. English constitutional democracy,
like 3 years later, he's like, "Where
did my body go?" Right? And um because
make no mistake, there's no such thing
as decapitation. They're actually
removing the body. Yeah. Right. You
know, and uh
>> but it's over very quickly. Um so you
know basically like these toxic ideas
why do these obviously toxic ideas
flourish in the French marketplace of
ideas in the world of like dangerous
leaison French you know aristocrats who
are like you know have you know 13
mistresses and like live in this like
very very sweet you know and rich way
it's the French revolution doesn't come
from the peasants it comes from the
aristocracy right and it comes from the
aristocracy trying to imitate the
English system of government which again
is one of these basically it's just like
you know what were the philosophs you
know doing what was voltaare doing at
that time he was basically doing gain of
function in like political science and
this creates a virus whose effects are
like still sweeping the globe today like
left versus right originates in the
French Revolution you know the color red
is a revolutionary color originates in
the French Revolution like you know it's
still actually you know we're still in
the age of that revolution. In fact,
>> it's very easy to identify political
tropes today that are directly related
to tropes in England literally 400 years
ago.
>> But but when the pitchfors come out, if
we have a bad king, it's easy, it's very
easy to replace it with a whole new
system. But when we have one bad
government, we just replace it with
another bad government.
>> We actually can't replace. So going back
to Aristotle's three systems, monarchy,
>> the government of one. Literally, let's
just use the literal word monarchy, the
government of one. Uh Queen Elizabeth
the first monarchy. Hitler monarchy.
Stalin monarchy. Kim Jong-un monarchy.
Even the terrible monarchy. Kufu who
built the pyramids monarchy. 98% of
human history monarchy. That's the
normal thing. That's what you get when
you stop digging. Yeah.
>> Okay. So right now we're in a hole and
we're very very deep in the hole. But
first of all, it's essential to
understand that when you value all time
periods equally, you know, as the great
German historian Leopold Vona said, all
all eras stand equal before God. Uh that
was he was not a Nazi. It was before
then. So we can say him. Um you know,
all all eras, you know, stand equal
before God is one of Ranka's great, you
know, utterances. The other one is to
tell history as it really was. And when
we tell history as it really was and all
eras stand equal before God. Suddenly
we're not restricting ourselves to you
know a sample of monarchs that's like
Hitler and Stalin. Hitler and Stalin
certainly exists but so does Louis the
10th. And we are not weighting Hitler
above Louis the 10th for some weird
reason. We are actually when we look at
Hitler and Stalin we're looking at
monarchy in the age of democracy which
is indeed a very problematic era for
monarchy in a lot of different senses.
Um but you know when you so that's
monarchy
oligarchy the rule of the few the
definition of that oligarchy can be can
take many forms our oligarchy is
essentially what previous periods would
have called a theocracy now it's an
atheistic theocracy but essentially you
can basically follow the ideology of
Harvard all the way from 1636 to today
and say there isn't really an aspect of
American culture from 1636 to now that
has like deviated from Harvardism in any
way where Harvardism is always a leading
indicator. Everything else becomes
Harvardism. The South be the South is
different. The South becomes Harvardism.
Everything is Harvardism. And so to
basically chart an intellectual history
of the United States, it is entirely
sufficient to chart an intellectual
history of Harvard. Harvard, by the way,
is actually I didn't know this until
like a few months ago when I found it
accidentally seriously implicated in the
Salem witch trials. Um, and the uh
not even the witch hunting is new,
right? You know, and and so, you know,
that's you're you know, this is why I'm
like 400 years. Okay, that would bring
us to, you know, 2036, which hasn't
quite happened yet, but um yeah, you can
identify basically sort of cracks in the
old regime that appear well before 1636,
but you're in England, not America.
Yeah. Um you know, and um
>> so that's basically theocracy,
oligarchy, meritocracy, the rule of
Harvard. These are all basically the
same things, right? And then you have,
you know, true literal democracy, the
rule of the demos, of the many. And
basically, when you're looking at the
rule of the many, um, it's very
attractive in a lot of ways. It's sort
of emotionally good. We all want to
believe that all men are created equal,
even though, you know, I guess I would
say I kind of compromise on that point
and say I can't really say that all men
are created equal, but I would say that
all identical twins are created equal.
But uh I'll go with that. I'll go with
that. I mean, you know, um but even
there you see differences, right? You
know, but but but but that's a good
baseline, right? You know, and uh
>> the you're saying, you know, with
democracy, everyone gets a vote and
everyone's got a brain.
>> Well, you know, not even everyone I
mean, see, here's the problem with
remember the New Yorker cartoon of like
the the passengers electing the pilot
and New Yorker is like, "Wow, democracy
is a really dumb idea." And I got to
agree with that, to be honest, right?
You know, I'm basically like, you know,
the conflict between oligarchy, literal
oligarchy, the conflict between
meritocracy and populism is a very
simple way to understand, you know, this
conflict. Surely, you know, a couple
that is always fighting and you know,
you talk to you're friends with both of
them, right? and you understand where
they're coming from and you're like, you
know, really the problem with this
relationship
is that he's right about her, but also
she's right about him. And you're just
like, do they deserve each other? I
don't know, but like he's right about
her and she's right about him. And you
see that basically when you understand
most conflicts from a sort of global
perspective usually your answer is in
some ways some ways you know there are
like you know sort of huge errors. So
you know in like World War II for
example the main charge of the Nazis is
they're fighting against the
international Jewish conspiracy which
doesn't exist. Uh the main idea of the
allies is they're fighting against the
Nazi plot to take over the world which
also doesn't exist. Right. And and it
doesn't exist. Um, go to a Wikipedia
page. Bring up a wiki the Wikipedia page
for Nazi foreign policy debate.
>> Say,
so Nazi Nazi foreign policy debate. Um,
so basically imagine if you're talking
so when Americans were fighting like my
grandfather were fighting in World War
II, they were basically like uh were
fighting against Hitler's plan to take
over the world. The my favorite part of
this page is the part where um yeah
yoken thieves the yoken thieves
basically here is the evidence for
here's the evidence from a serious
historian for Hitler's plan to dominate
the world. The evidence is he liked
really big buildings and people who want
to dominate the world also like really
big buildings. Hold on, let's read.
Yeah, they got arguments for the case of
the globalist. Yantis has been noted say
that plans for world domination can be
seen Hitler's ideology of displaying
power. The creation of magnificent
buildings, the use of propaganda to
demonstrate German strength along with
the message to create the right to a
thousand years clearly shows Hitler's
aspirations for the future. I mean,
that's obviously a terrible argument.
>> That's a very Imagine if that was
imagine if that was the best argument
for like the reality of the Holocaust.
You and I, the Holocaust is one of the
best documented events in human history,
right? You and I would have to be, if
that was the best evidence for the
Holocaust, I would go out on the street
and scream the Holocaust didn't happen.
>> Yeah, but there was there was certain
expansionism in the war.
>> Sure, there was expansionism in Eastern
Europe. You know who else expanded in
Eastern Europe? Frederick the Great. You
know how much George Washington worried
about Frederick the Great? Not at all.
Right. So you know essentially you're
like basically you know in that war was
so screwed up that you know even then
even in that situation the number one
argument as expressed at the time of the
Germans is we are fighting against the
international Jewish conspiracy. The
number one argument of the
Anglo-Americans is we are fighting
against Hitler's plan to take over the
world. Those arguments are both
completely bogus. However, arguments
like 2 through 10 on both sides are
basically correct.
>> Yeah, I don't know what that is.
>> Um, so for example, uh, you know,
argument number two on the allied side
is, by the way, they're doing a lot of
human rights abuses. Also true. You
know, I could go arguments through
arguments two through 10 on the Nazi
side, but we would we would probably get
bogged down in that [ __ ] Yeah.
>> You know, and but argument number one on
both sides is just complete crap, right?
It's just absolute crap. There's no
international Jewish conspiracy. I'm
sorry, gorers. It doesn't exist, right?
You know, but like arguments 2 through
10, you know, that's a little more
interesting. You know, in any case,
basically, you see these just like the
world in what we call the age of
democracy is just like thrust into these
delusions because the set of delusions
is spread in the demos as opposed to the
Aristo as opposed to the oligarchy.
There's a completely different set of
forces
that dictate like the success of a meme
on Facebook, which is what we're
actually looking at when we look at true
literal democracy, not grass, not
astroturf democracy, but grassroots
democracy. You know, the truth is that
astroturf really astronomically sucks
and basically gave us co right and
that's just an example like all over the
government all over the way we think
about politics and power is these ideas
that have been evolved for a hundred
years to be as powerful as possible and
often bear no resemblance to reality are
basically what is like you know look at
our ideas about criminal justice why you
know look at our ideas about like
teaching reading in schools all of these
ideas, you know, get, you know, just
become like sinister parodies of
themselves until education becomes
anti-education. Billy has become the
weather underground guy becomes like the
leader of our educational system. Like
insane things are happening in every
direction because we took the cold
alpine lake and we connected it to the
sewer and we didn't put in a valve.
>> But we are there now. So, like,
you know, there's one per I won't name
them. There's one there's one person I
spoke to that I was interviewing you and
they were like, "Ah, but that it's
crazy. It's like crazy right-wing
ideas." But bear with me. But it's like
crazy right-wing ideas. What the hell
are you doing? But at the same time,
there's a growing number of people who
want to listen to Curtis Yavin discuss
democracy. And uh
>> there's that word again.
>> Yeah. Well, they want to but they want
Well, they want to hear you talk about
why you don't believe in democracy, why
it's failed. And like if we just look at
the UK as a great example at the moment,
it's it's so [ __ ] We're so [ __ ]
>> Imagine you had told any Englishman from
before 1900 the story of the UK, which
is a word that nobody used, by the way.
Um, nobody said UK, they said Britain or
they said England. Um, and
>> well, let me just finish cuz like we're
so [ __ ] at the moment that in the
space of a few short years, a party that
never existed looks like it's going to
win the next election. And
>> in 2029,
>> yeah, in 2029, but they've come they've
come from like nowhere to dominate the
political discourse. And look, there's a
lot of people there's a lot of people
who will say yes, nothing's going to
change. Nothing ever happens.
But the reasons it's happened is because
they've all faith in the left party.
They've lost all faith in the
Conservatives, Labour. It's like they
need something new. But at the moment,
sorry, bear with me. There's something
new is it's a new color party. It's not
a new idea. And what it is is that
you're at least just saying, look, can
can we at least just have the
conversation that this this idea is a
terrible idea? That's that's what you're
basically saying.
Do you know the term wig history?
>> No.
>> Uh that's wig with an H, right? And wig
history you which is identified or
described as such by the historian
Herbert Butterfield in the 1930s I
believe is basically this sort of belief
in like monotonic progress and like it
was really a lot of wig history comes
from just watching the progress of
technology which is actually totally
extrinsic to government. like every form
of 20th century government in major
nations seems to have done quite well
with this. You know, it's not like the
Nazis were bad at science. It's not like
the Soviets were bad at science. Um, you
know, so using science as an endorsement
of our system of government is pretty
lame when, you know, the US basically
stole the Nazi rocket program and used
it to go to the moon, right? And then
you're like, "Oh yeah, science. We do
science." You know, ver you know the the
Tom Lair line about Vernon Brown. Oh,
you never you know Tom Lair. He was this
great he was a mathematician and comic
songwriter an amazing figure huge figure
among American nerds for the last 30
years. He recently passed away. He put
because he was a nerd he put all his
lyrics in the public domain. And there's
a great one about Verer von Brown who is
of course the director of the Nazi
rocket program who's promptly in 1945
moved to America and becomes the
director of the Apollo program and
literally directs the program that puts
Neil Armstrong on the moon like he
doesn't even lose his job right he just
moves to Alabama and um the line is um
um you know um let me remember the Tom
Ver ver Tom Lur line um
you know Veron Brown, you know, Veravon
Brown. Uh, you know, the rockets go up.
Who knows why they come down? It's not
my department, says Veravon Brown.
So, the Nazis actually pretty fine at
science, right? You know, and like
they're still Nazis, right? They still
like the Holocaust. That's a real thing,
right? You know, and and so actually
taking credit for the rise of science,
people are like, "Oh, well, you don't
want democracy." Uh, you know, but
democracy invented antibiotics. I'm
like, that's true, but the Nazis build
the rockets, you know?
>> Yeah. But like the I think what I'm
trying to get into is that there there
is like in the like say in the UK we're
[ __ ] There's no agreement on
anything. I had the conversation with my
son on the way over cuz I'd had an
argument with somebody and he was like,
>> "Everyone's replaying the same arguments
each other. There's no agreement on
anything." And people are looking for an
escape valve.
>> You've hit rock bottom.
>> Well, yeah. You've hit rock bottom.
Where's the escape valve? Where's the
therapy? Like therapy.
>> Yeah. Are we going to build, you know,
the labor anthem, uh, you know, till we
build Jerusalem in England's green and
pleasant land? You ever heard that one?
>> Yeah. And we used to have to sing it at
school.
>> Yeah. That's because you live in a
communist country.
>> Hello, wake up.
>> But but the point is it's like people
are looking for that escape valve. But
but if the escape valve is discussing
the idea that maybe this democracy is a
bad idea, it's like, whoa, whoa, we
can't have that discussion. That's
exactly what it was like in the Soviet
Union in 1978 87 to say maybe communism
was actually a bad idea.
>> Yeah,
>> maybe actually the whole thing was a
mistake and maybe you know it's like I
was talking to a Frenchman once like 10
years ago and he's like well yeah the
French Revolution is a very complicated
you know we had a a good the first
revolution was a good revolution and
then we had a bad revolution. I'm like,
"My friend, my brother in Christ." Have
you ever heard of AAM's razor?
And and you know the uh the I won't say
he was enlightened, but hopefully it
helped. You know, and and like you know,
AAM's razor is just like what what if
actually what if all of this sort of you
know,
>> you know, one thing that I find that's
sort of super interesting when I go and
debunk the past. There's a couple of
things I find. Um, could you type into
the browser window uh the phrase go up
to the browser bar and type the phrase
true history of the American Revolution.
True history of the American Revolution.
Oh wow. It's a book called The True
History of the American Revolution. You
might want to click on that. Click on
the old page images. True History of the
American Revolution by Sydney George
Fischer.
>> Sydney George Fischer. I'd never heard
of this person. I don't know how I found
this book. Found it.
>> But when when when do you think just
from looking at that page, when do you
think that book was published?
>> Well, I mean, I can see Alexander
Hamilton has
>> sure, but anyone can quote Hamilton.
When do you think it was published?
>> I don't know. You might tell me
recently.
>> 1903.
>> Oh [ __ ]
>> Oh [ __ ] 1903. Very old. Right. And I,
you know, I look at this book and I
start reading this book. You can flip
the page images. There's a really nice
there's a really nice line in there. Um,
wait, wait, back. Go back. Read the
first read the first paragraph.
>> Okay. The purpose of the history of the
revolution is to use the original
authorities rather more frankly has been
the practice with our historians. They
appear to have thought it advisable to
emit from the narratives a great deal
which seems essential to this. This
comes back to the point is like the the
winners of the war get to write the
history.
>> That's right. And so if you scroll if
you scroll down a little bit whatever we
mean go to the next page. We're getting
into too into the weeds here. Go to the
next page. Um there's the at the end of
the introduction to this. Keep going.
Um okay. Um go up. Go up.
There's a ah yes at the the start the
sentence the the start of the go to the
previous page. Um
>> all right. Scroll to the bottom.
>> Before I discovered the emissions start
reading there.
>> Okay. Okay. Before I discovered the
emissions of our standard keep going on
histories always felt as though I was
reading about something that never
happened and that was contrary to the
original experience of human nature. I
could not understand how a movement
which was so supposed to have led to
such a deep uprooting of of settled
thought and custom. A movement which is
supposed to have been one of the great
epochs of history could have happened
like an occurrence in a fairy tale. I
could not understand the military
operations and it seemed strange to me
that they were not investigated,
explained and criticized like those of
Napoleon's campaigns of our own civil
war.
>> I was never satisfied civil war
obviously.
>> Yeah. I was never satisfied until I
spent a great deal of time in research
borrowing into the dust of the hundreds
of brown pamphlets, newspapers, letters,
personal memoirs, documents and
publications of historical societies and
the interminable
debates of parliament which now that the
eyewitnesses are dead constitute all the
evidence that has left us of the story
of the revolutions. Those musty
documents painted a very vivid picture
upon my mind and I wish I had the power
of painting the picture as the original.
>> All right, stop stop. So you can go
deeper. This rat hole is very deep. It
is a beautiful rat hole. And like those
those sentences left a very deep
impression on my mind because actually
he tries very hard to paint that
picture. And you're just like, "Oh wow,
that never made sense to me before,
right?" You know, and I'm just basically
the American Revolution is the Vietnam
War in the 18th century. It is
essentially a domestic political
conflict which becomes a war overseas.
And because it is fundamentally based on
a domestic political conflict, that war
does not make sense militarily like the
Vietnam War.
>> And there's actually a recent book by an
English historian named Robert Harvey
that I just found randomly in a used
bookstore. And I'd been going around
saying the American Revolution is the
Vietnam War in the 18th century. And I
read this book, which was clearly
published several years before I had
sent anything of the like on the
internet. And he's like, you know, guys,
here's the here's the answer. The
American Revolution is the Vietnam War
in the 18th century. And and and so
you're just like basically you just
break this whole thing in in in in
criticize the funny thing is that if you
want to talk to Americans and criticize
their picture of the American Civil War
or the um World War II
um both of which they ascribe deep
emotional importance to is a very tricky
prospect and you can do this and there
are very important revisions that need
to be made but you know you are
constantly stepping on people's emotions
but they don't give a crap about the
American Revolution right and so
actually like basically you know just
the fact I mean you step back a second
and you know think about imagine you
grew up in like lower Slovia right and
you all your life you'd heard about the
glorious Slovian revolution George
Slovich you know who wouldn't you know
cut down the cherry tree or whatever and
you're just like wow you know this
really sounds like mythical cult of
personality propaganda history but uh
you know the alternative is communism so
I guess I'll believe in my mythical
propaganda you know history and then you
know suddenly
Slovia invents a search engine and you
go to your search engine and you type in
true history of the Slovian revolution
and you get that and you're just like
wait a second you know you just broke my
brain with a book from 1903 right and
there's a lot more where that came from
And so, you know, essentially when you
reject, you know, 400 years of like
shitty politicized history, which has
been politicized in almost exactly the
same way as vyology actually. But
there's that word again, politicized.
Political
>> politicized because power has corrupted
it. Because basically the fact that
history matters leads to historians and
this was you know if you kept reading he
you would you encounter Sydney George
Fischer. I have no idea who this person
was saying exactly what I just said. um
is that essentially when you take a
field of inquiry and you say this field
of inquiry previously pure is going to
have an impact on the world. The fact
that it has an impact on the world has
an impact on that marketplace of ideas.
And basically our system of government
was built by people who did not
recognize or understand that reality
which is just a fundamental engineering
fact of political science. They just
left a term out of their equation. And
>> so everything is just narrative.
>> Everything is just narrative. And that
narrative has evolved to be as powerful
as possible. But it's almost like then
that couple, you talked about the couple
before that argue all the time, but they
spend their whole life together and all
their friends are like, "You guys like
in why haven't they broken up?" And
that's basically what this democracy is.
Then it's like,
>> yeah, it's it's it's democracy. If you
split the word democracy into
meritocracy and populism, democracy is
just meritocracy versus populism. And
you're sort of, you know, and you're
just like, you know, both of these
things really suck. But like the couple
who doesn't want to split up even having
the conversation with the vast majority
of people that yeah dem this democracy
thing is a terrible idea. It's like whoa
whoa we're not going to do that.
>> No. And actually but the thing is
everybody who believes democracy is
great believes either that populism is
great or that meritocracy is great.
>> But they also all of them believe that
either populism is awful or meritocracy
is awful. And so actually just splitting
the word in half into its reality and
not letting it retain this fatal
ambiguity
allows you to basically sort of defeat
each of these things in detail. And so
you can say to the populace, okay, dude,
you're so right about universities and
newspapers. You know, the lying press,
you know, the mainstream media, they lie
all the time. It's like very, very true.
They really suck. And like I want to
like speak to you and like understand
that you just have this deeply felt
intuitive sense that these people cannot
go on governing us. That this is
absolutely corrupt and absolutely
impossible and absolutely sucks. And let
me explain to you why you're right about
this using like big words and the
marketplace of ideas and so forth. And
then but you got to be like
on the other hand, you know, let's let's
look at what like memes win on Facebook,
right? And you're just like actually,
you know, are you really going to run
the government based on what memes work
win on Facebook? Because, you know, Elon
Musk, for example, is a big believer in,
you know, literal democracy. You know,
he once posted like Voxuli, Vox day,
like what the people believe must be
true. I'm like, I don't see it, you
know. I just don't see it. I just don't
see it. Right? You know, and so
actually, you know, here's the problem.
You have this couple who is right about
each other. And as Aristotle said,
there's only two for Oh, wait. There's a
third form of government which has been
used basically by 98% of regimes for all
of history. Moreover, this third form of
governance, which is monarchy, which is
basically just a description of an or of
a pyramid-shaped org chart, is not only
used by 98% of governments in history,
it is used by all effective
organizations in the world today.
>> It's used in our home.
>> It is used absolutely because it is the
family. If you buy this phone, it comes
in a box saying designed in California
by Apple, assembled in China. All right,
that is three organizations. California,
Apple, and China. And among those
organizations are two monarchies and two
one party states. China and California
obviously are the one party states.
China and Apple are obviously the
monarchies. And if you imagine and if
you say, well, one party states are bad.
Well, you know, California is a pretty
nice place actually. Um, and if you
imagine the government of California,
not through a contractor, but literally
itself. Imagine Calrans, the California
Department of Cal of of Transportation
designing an iPhone.
>> Imagine it assembling an iPhone.
>> Just wouldn't.
>> It's like imagine like imagining like
chickens inventing algebra, right? You
know, and so you're basically like
actually go to see a movie, it has a
director, that's a monarch. Go to a
restaurant, there's a chef, that's a
monarch. You know, go to a chain
restaurant, it has a CEO who
monarchically comes up with the recipes.
Imagine if like, you know, say what you
want about Chipotle. If you had
Chipotle, it's all right. It's all
right. But imagine if the customers of
Chipotle voted on the Chipotle recipes.
>> Yes.
>> Yes. You can imagine that.
>> What a Chipotle last under those in that
situation.
>> Well, that's why my my home with my kids
isn't a democracy.
>> Exactly. And so, you know, essentially,
you know,
>> but but by the way, my children have
their pitchforks.
>> They do. They do. They do. and and
>> and and sorry also if you don't like
Chipotle, you don't go to Chipotle.
>> You don't go to Chipotle. So, you know,
monopolies are harder. You know, this
was something that was very accurately
pointed out by Professor Jones in our
debate earlier today. actually the
constraints of the this is why I think
that like small not only are small
states better than big states like you
know the best periods in human history
the most generative amazing you know
periods have been like large numbers of
competing small states moreover these
small states compete basically in two
ways they compete in trade of course
because they're like essentially
businesses competing for export markets
but they also compete by making war And
unfortunately, war has devolved into
this like inhuman thing of like press a
button and kill people joystick drone
hunting videos. I don't know why
actually Ukraine hasn't basically
allowed like anyone over the internet to
like operate drones and kill Russians.
That would be just be the insane like
that's the modern Yeah, exactly. Like
you
>> It's like Fortnite.
>> Yeah. People would pay people would pay.
They would pay to actually be virtually
on the front lines and operate drones
that kill people. And then the Russians
would do it too.
>> It's like a It's like a merger of Hostel
and Have you seen the film Hostile?
>> No.
>> Where they where they bid they bid to
torture people. It's like a It's like a
merger between Hostile and Fortnite.
>> This could happen next week.
>> Yeah.
>> Actually, someone someone in the Ukraine
could watch this video and be like, gosh
darn that's a good idea.
>> But like Curtis, if I go home to the
England after this, I'm like, oh Curtis
onto something here. I [ __ ] this
democracy thing. If I if I try and
explain that to any of my friends and
family leftists, they're they're they're
going to be disgusted like
>> and so in a way,
>> but let me finish the point. They're
going to be disgusted like you cannot
take this idea or what like democracy
it's like we all must have an opinion
>> first thing the first
>> but the conservative friends
>> some like well I think he's got a point
but he's going too far but you know
>> not always not always not always and
this is why basically you know uh
Confucious had this great line you know
not enough people site Confucious but
great man Confucious uh Confucious had
this great line about the rectification
of names he was basically like to repair
the state and you know Chinese
governance in Confucious's day had many
of the same problems that it has today.
He's like basically he he's sort of with
Orwell on this. He's like basically
Orwell is like the main problem in
politics is we are confused by the words
that we use. We need to just we need to
fix the words because we have all of
this Orwellian like goodspeak language.
This
>> this is why I don't say the word that
starts with div and ends in ursity.
>> Okay. Right? And um you know if I want a
lot of different kinds of flowers in a
bouquet I would be like I want a lot
like a lot of variety of flowers right
you know and I advise everyone to do
that is like instantly helpful. Um do
not use that word and
you know but the word democracy just by
having these two opposed meanings where
people democracy really means
legitimate. It means powerful. It means
you have the right to rule. And so
people like fight over this word, you
know, the populists are like, "No, we're
the real democracy." George Soros is
like, "No, I Emperor Palpatine am the
real democracy." Right? You know, and
and like, you know, civil society,
that's the real democracy. And he's, you
know, you can see where he's coming
from. I respect where he's coming from.
His views on populism are very
unsympathetic. You know, Tommy
Robinson's views on um George Soros are
also very unsympathetic. And you know,
frankly, I believe they both kind of
have a point, right? You know, and this
is why I'm a monarchist. I'm basically
like, actually, your first step is to
basically split these things apart. Then
when you're talking to your leftist
friends, say, "All right, when you say
democracy, you're really arguing over
who owns this word, which means we're in
charge."
North Korea, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. That is three
synonyms for democracy and one place
name. and it's a monarchy. Um, and like
so just don't do that, right? You know,
stop with that stuff, right? And and
like, you know, let's sort of look at
this situation objectively. Let's say
that we agree that when we say
democracy, we mean these two things,
meritocracy
and populism, and then talk to your
leftist friends and basically say,
"Yeah, we agree about populism." You
know, maybe you can even use slurs, talk
about the gammons or something. You the
chavs, you know, um you know, get get
contemptuous with them. Uh wear a long
sleeve shirt to hide your tattoo. Well,
the tattoos are fine actually. You know,
but like there's a little bit of like
>> it's the conservatives who hate the
tattoos.
>> You know, when I was at the um you know,
the festival in England, wonderful
festival, wonderfully organized, where I
debated Alistister Campbell um and and
which is now available online. And you
could bring it up even um you know and
um you know I haven't watched I never
watched myself. My wife liked it but she
likes everything so who knows maybe I
totally you know flamed out but I think
I did okay. I I certainly didn't get but
>> I'm only going to hope that you give him
a hard time.
>> I did but in a nice way
>> I love this. Look they started with the
philosopher
>> don't even don't even let's not even go
there. Let's shut up with that.
>> They don't lead with Curtis Yavin
anymore. They were like the guy the
philosopher behind JD Vans. It's so bad.
Everyone needs to stop with that right
away.
>> Yeah, but
>> I haven't talked with them in ages. But
>> you're using it as a porative against
fans.
>> Uh, sure. I know. And that's why I
haven't talked with them in ages and I
don't want to either, you know, and like
the the the um
>> I like it more
>> and and and it's but in any case um the
the um you know one of the things they
did very nicely at um the um rather
cringely named How the Light Gets In
festival was uh the security I thought
was very good. And the security
consisted of me being followed around by
a fellow who um you know basically if I
had to guess I would say that he was a
Milw wall supporter.
>> Okay.
>> And you know like you he had many
tattoos but unlike you many of them were
on his face and I felt very comforted by
the presence of this I believe you would
call him a yabo. and he seemed like a
good sort, a very good chap, you know,
and like actually like I I realized that
many um if you go to you know uh and
this was in North London and actually in
North London they don't like the Yabos
so much or so I'm told.
>> Was it was it were you in Islington?
>> Um it was um Hamstead.
>> Oh yeah. I mean look this is our
champagne socialist.
>> Yeah, it was all the crowd was all
champagne socialist.
>> They would be voting for man.
>> It was hardcore champagne socialist. So
imagine me debating Alistister Campbell
in front of 200 champagne socialists.
Amazing. Amazing. No, I you know I'm I'm
just care about first of all in a
situation like that your goal is not
actually I mean you would love of course
to have this happen but he's not going
to let it happen. Your goal is to not
make Alistair Campbell look bad. Your
goal is just to make yourself look good.
And that is also the best way to try to
make Alistister Campbell look bad
because he is of course going to try to
make you look bad and you just have to
be completely insucant about it. And
that's the secret for if you ever find
yourself in a room with Darth Vader and
you're like, "Where's my lightsaber?"
That's how you do it.
>> I don't think I I don't think I'm going
to get to spend any time.
>> You know, I don't think so. I I would be
lovely if he would come on your show.
But
>> yeah, I think I've called him a war
criminal too many times.
>> Yeah. See, I had a very different
approach to Alistister Kimble. I was
like, you know, Alistister, like you and
I have something in common. We both
supported the invasion of Iraq.
And then I go on to explain why I feel
this was a mistake and like I learned
something from it and then inviting him
to do the same, which of course he does
not do.
>> No, he has to rationalize it and then go
swimming and talk about trees.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Ex. And that's how you
deal with Alison Campbell, right? You
know,
>> okay, it was good. It was fun. and I do
it again. Uh, you know, okay, probably
with a few beers, but
>> but but okay. So, look.
>> So, so you know, if I can just if I can
summarize my response to that question,
you know, your friends are going to be
horrified. And basically, the way to,
you know, make friends and influence
people. This is something, by the way,
that the late Charlie Kirk was brilliant
at. He would be like, you got to start
with agreement. You got to find a point
of agreement. And once you find a point
of agreement, you are on the same side
as the person, you can work from there.
And basically, if you can say, look, you
know, I completely agree with you about
populism. It is ridiculous that the
passengers should elect some rando to
fly the plane, right? You know, that is
basically absurd. And let's agree with
that because the main force of basically
both sides is hitting the other. This is
the truth that they feel that they have
that the other side doesn't have.
And in this case, what's fortunate is
that it's kind of basically an accurate
truth. Like World War II is really
[ __ ] up because both sides are like
have this like lie that they're basing
everything on. And you know, that's one
of the things that makes that war really
uniquely horrible is that both sides are
fighting for a lie. It's insane.
Actually, the great book on World War II
that everyone should read is a book by
probably our greatest author, a man
named Nicholson Baker. And he wrote a
book called Human Smoke, which contains
none of his own words. It is entirely
plagiarized. And it consists entirely of
tweet length excerpts arranged
chronologically from World War II. And
the great conclusion that you get from
this book, which is basically the
introduction to the true study of the
20th century is that World War II was
not a Marvel movie.
And once you're ready to accept that
World War II was not a Marvel movie, you
are ready to study history. And until
then, you were just a child and you
should be kept out of the library.
And that is my strong feeling. And if
you want to break past that, read Human
Smoke. It is a great book by one of our
greatest writers. I've written it down.
>> And published by I mean hugely published
like amazing, you know, like like this
is not a fringe alternative book. This
is not a book where you freak out if
like somebody might see it on your your
bookshelf. This is like completely
conventional.
It's very important that you don't lose
this, okay? This is your inheritance
through Bitcoin.
A
>> let Bitcoin rip. Don't rip up your
Bitcoin. Set up inheritance with Casa.
[Music]
So, on this podcast, you are definitely
hearing me talk about Bitcoin a lot.
Well, why? We live in a really strange
time with governments driving inflation
with their reckless spending and endless
money printing. There is a way out of
this. There is a way to protect your
money and that is by stacking Bitcoin.
I've made loads of shows about Bitcoin.
You can go and research this. You can go
and read the books. But the truth is it
is the hardest money ever created. If
you are interested in protecting your
financial future, it's time for you to
get on the Bitcoin train. I have. I've
been stacking Bitcoin personally and
through my businesses since 2017. It's
protected me. It's secured my family's
future and it also strengthens all of my
businesses. So, if you want to start
stacking Bitcoin, where do you do it?
Well, for me is with Gemini. They're a
fully licensed full reserve exchange and
custodian. So, they give you a secure
way for you to buy and own your Bitcoin.
There's no risks and no funny business.
So, if you're serious about stacking
Bitcoin the right way, head over to
gemini.com, which is gem ni.com. But
look, Curtis, if if you're right, if
you're right, like we need to stop this
[ __ ] now. But but the it's it's
>> But you can't just stop this [ __ ] We
need to start something else.
>> Well, that's the point. It's not a
palatable idea. Like people aren't going
to we're not going to wake up as a
nation, have enough people go, "Yeah,
this is a terrible idea. We need to we
need to bring back a monol." Certainly
not. Well, we've got Charles as king cuz
that would be a terrible monarch. But
>> well, what if what if Well, you know,
I'm just
>> But I feel like it'll only come through
force.
>> That's how I feel.
>> Two things. Let me just throw this out
there. What if Charles III is not really
the legitimate king because 1688 was
illegitimate? If you agree that 1688 was
illegitimate, then the legitimate throne
of England runs through a complicated,
you know, strain of princesses and
whatever until it winds up in the kings
of Bavaria. And from the kings of
Bavaria, it flows actually to um one of
today's few working monarchs who
actually is an absolute working monarch
and not just a crown Kardashian which is
Hans Autumn II of Likenstein. And
actually the true what if the true
monarch of England is I believe his name
is Prince Joseph Venzel who is the son
of of Hans Adam and was the first true
prince of the Stewart lineage to be ever
be born in England. Okay. Now setting
that aside setting that aside you know
the reality is that monarchy means a lot
of different things. It means basically
it simply means you know unitary
authority over the state. You can have
an elected monarch. You can have a
monarch elected by a royal family. Uh,
of course in the private sector we have
these pseudo states called corporations
and we see so here's an example of you
know the question of monarchy. I was I
got I did this I thought actually it was
done it was very well done uh you know
my New York Times interview right and
>> he asks me in that interview I'm like
defending the idea of monarchy and I'm
like you know actually like you know my
favorite monarchy the most important
monarchy today uh is a fifth generation
absolute hereditary monarchy called the
New York Times.
>> Yeah, I love that.
>> And you know but here's what actually
happened you know behind the scenes of
that moment. So I'm basically like,
you know, and look at the New York
Times, which is a fifth generation
absolute hereditary monarchy. Actually,
the way that works is super interesting.
The New York Times has a dual class
share structure. Class A and class B
shares. Anyone can buy class B shares on
the exchange and they, you know, get,
you know, dividends or if the New York
Times dains to pay dividends, but they
have no power over the corporation.
power of the corporation is held
entirely by the holders of class A
shares who are all the descendants of
Adolf Ox and he has quite a few
descendants and interestingly the system
is very similar to a system that you
know exists at the sovereign level which
is the um kingdom of Saudi Arabia in
which very similar power although it's
much more informal is held by the
descendants of Iban Saudban Saud
believed in polygamy so there's there's
really quite quite a you descendants of
human sad but they managed to come
together and you know elect you know MBS
you know right you know NBS
>> elect
>> not elect but choose not elect in a
formal process but they choose MBS you
know tell me how are you know we know
how presidents are chosen but how are
presidential candidates chosen um you
know
>> yeah that's fair yeah or or removed
>> we want the formal process but we
actually don't care about the formal
process is we just want good results. We
just want a good government, right? And
say what you want. I mean, you know,
honestly, there's a couple of different
perspectives. I can see why people have
varying opinions about MBS cuz for
example, you know, they call him, you
know, Muhammad Bonesaw for a reason,
right? There was this case of Kosoi, you
know, who um I mean, it's really rather
I'm so torn on this. It's really rather
a sad story because you know this guy
was um you know um he's in exile, right?
He leaves Saudi Arabia. He's left this
this life behind him, but he wants to
get married to his girlfriend. To do
that, he needs a divorce. To do that,
he's in Turkey. He needs to go to the
Saudi embassy to get some paperwork. He
goes to the Saudi embassy, just shows up
unannounced. He's like, "I need this
paperwork." They're like, "Oh, well, uh
thinking very quickly, uh we don't have
this ready. you need to come back in a
week. He comes back in a week, you know,
there's this uh assass and his
girlfriend is outside the embassy
watching, right? And there's a Saudi
assassination team inside and they sees
him as soon as he, you know, um, you
know, gets upstairs, they sees him, they
literally, you know, they rip his
clothes off, they saw him apart with a
bone saw, you know, the body, whatever
has never been found. And then someone
to fool the security cameras comes out
of the embassy wearing his clothes.
Okay. And and the dark. Okay. Dark dark.
But on the other hand on the other hand,
he was a journalist.
>> Sorry. But
the
dark I know. I know. I know. Um but in
any case, you know, actually he wasn't
really a journalist. He was a Saudi
power player. And this is really what
makes it like he hadn't actually left
that life behind. He was still a player.
And so it was a gang hit on a gangster.
He didn't even write his own stories. He
uh they were basically ghostwritten for
him by Qatar. He was a former like, you
know, number three guy, the Saudi
intelligence, right? You know, this is a
gang hit on a gangster. And this is the
real reason I'm actually not sad. Uh I
know many journalists. I love many
journalists. Many of them are beautiful
people. they can usually write English,
which this guy basically could not do.
Um, so there's that. But on the other
hand, it's a good it's a good bit. But,
um, I don't know why people think you're
controversial.
>> There you go. Um, I've just made an enmy
enemy of all journalists for all time.
You know, you know, actually, you know,
let me say positive things. And this is
one of the things I said to uh, you
know, Marches. I was just like actually
in all of these institutions
everywhere in these very deeply darkly
corrupted institutions that have like
been evolved by this sort of power
craving into like the opposite of their
purpose whether they're doing viology or
education or diplomacy.
Everywhere in these institutions you
will find these little points of light
who are like individual people who
actually believe in the real mission.
These are the viologists who question
basically gain of function research. You
know, these are the diplomats who said,
"Well, maybe we don't need to expand
NATO to the east." These are, you know,
the educational people who are like,
"Well, maybe we actually need to teach
children to read, right?" You know,
everywhere you find these like little
>> crazy people.
>> Yeah. They're crazy to try to exist
within these professions, but they exist
and they basically are like very careful
and some of them are very good. And
actually some of the top journalists in
the world are like totally based and
absolutely wonderful.
>> Yeah,
>> that's the reality.
>> The um
>> you know, but the majority not so much.
>> The Kosogi thing reminds me of what Dave
Smith said recently. He was talking
about the Jimmy Kimmel incident and he
said what you have to understand is like
Jimmy Kimmel is the regime.
>> Yeah.
>> He's not an independent.
>> No, no, no. You're not you're not
pushing back. People are starting to
understand that they're starting to
basically see this kind of shape of
power in a way. You know, it's like one
of the things that Yeltson did in the
fall of the Soviet Union, which as a
15-year-old, I'm watching this. I've
been like reading the, you know,
economist in the Herald Tribune for
like, you know, seven or eight years or
something. And I'm like, he bans the
Communist Party. I'm like, who bans
parties? Like, bad people ban parties.
It's bad to ban parties, right? He bans
the Communist Party. And actually this
is what needed to be done because
actually this institution is not the New
York Times is not a free market
institution. Okay, the New York Times is
a government agency. If it was actually
the department of information if
actually if it was literally identified
as a government agency you would
instantly realize number one it is the
most powerful agency in the government.
Number two, like the idea that the New
York Times can basically take
information from any other part of the
government and steal it and sell it
makes no sense if it's a private
company, but makes complete sense if it
is the most powerful agency in the
government. Actually, in the kind of
founding document of 20th century
journalism, which is a book by the great
Walter Lipman called Public Opinion,
1922, which everyone should read. Um
there's it's what's one of the things
that's remarkable is that he compares
journalism to an intelligence agency and
he's like these are the same thing and
you're just like all right you you're
off your wait
>> you're not off your rocker
>> and so actually like yeah you know
treating when you see here's the thing
about regime change is that you're
basically in this world where you're
just like you've lost all hope and it's
like really good that you've lost all
hope because you sort of reach rock
bottom and you're just like your last
idea is like, you know, there's just
nothing I can do. And then you have this
idea, well, maybe I could quit. And it
seems so impossible and so difficult and
you've tried so hard before, like maybe
you can just quit, right? And just
quitting involves giving up a lot of
these glittering ideas and a lot of this
feeling of like, wow, you know, I play
guitar so much better when I'm on
cocaine and you know, all of these
things. And you just actually have to
say no. You know, you have no other
alternative but to just opin in these
sort of sweet glittery concepts that are
so meritious when you dig into them that
seem to mean so much to you and
basically say, you know, yeah, what if
we've actually just been making a huge
mistake for the last 400 years?
>> Okay. So, all right. Fine.
>> Yes.
>> Fine.
>> Have I bludgeoned you into submission
yet?
>> No, cuz No, because I came with an open
mind because like let's discuss
everything. There you go.
>> Let's just discuss everything. Like the
the person who said to me today who was
I'll talk about it afterwards was didn't
like the fact that I was going to talk
to you. It's like well why can't we
discuss it? It might be a terrible idea.
But but if you talk about monarchs but
you also talk about like a CEO. Yes.
>> And and to most people that they're
entirely different things. Like a
monarch is a little bit hereditary. You
can get the bad king. Whereas a CEO you
get a bad CEO they kind of it's easy to
get rid of them.
Not always. So here's an example. Not
always. So here's an example. Remember I
talked about the governance structure of
the New York Times. Well, actually the
only people that can get rid of King
Solsberger are the descendants of Adolf
Ox. But it actually goes even further
than that. So you know the governance of
Meta Facebook
>> is actually far more absolutist than
that. No one can get rid of Mark
Zuckerberg. He has all the class A
shares.
>> Yeah. people can just stop buying the
New York Times, stop reading it or stop,
you know, stop using Facebook,
>> there are always essentially and so when
you see that effect,
>> that's the peasants.
>> Yeah. When you see that effect of
basically what you're saying in a way is
ultimately if a thing sucks. I'm a CEO
myself, right? I know what it is to be a
CEO. I've never succeeded hugely. Yeah,
I'm a CEO. And um the um the the uh we
can get into that. um you know it's
related to your other interest and um
the um and you know if you're in the
world of the of the CEO basically of
like the startup CEO which is a very
intense way to be a CEO because um
>> you know there's a line in Ben
Horowitz's startup uh you know book
which is or an acronym which is WFIO
which means what we're forked it's over
um you know and everyone who has run a
startup has like multiple like wfio
moment like exactly right you know and
so you know you know to be a king in
these like dire kind of straits it's
like being king Alfred of England like
King Alfred must have had if you
remember anything about King Alfred back
in the 800s or whatever he had a lot of
WFIO moments right you know Churchill
had his WFIO moments right you know and
so that energy that sort of temper of
competition needs to be supplied it
doesn't need to be supplied applied to
any organization because monopolies can
kind of monopolies kind of suck in a
way, but they're still they still have
incentives. They're still responsive.
You know, the CEO of PG& still cares
what you know, which is our electric
company, which is private for some
reason, still cares about how much
money, how many dividends he sends out
to his shareholders occasionally.
There's still tension. That need for
tension is essentially really important
in any kind of you know governance
system and any structural system because
without tension things just collapse in
a way and so the best level of tension
you get from sort of various kinds of
competitive governance and there's a lot
of ways you know you know for example
you know countries compete to have you
know a balance of trade you know like
we're currently getting reamed by China
like you know in that way. And when
Donald Trump says we're losing a
trillion dollars a year to China, like
he's absolutely right. That is the
correct terms in which to describe it,
right? You know, he I would truthfully I
would go I could spend an hour
explaining why
just by the way he talks in that way,
Donald Trump understands economics
better than 99.99%
of professional, you know, economists.
Even though that makes me sound like
it's of Kim Jong-un. professional
economist or Keynesian economist.
>> Economics professors.
>> Okay.
>> Economics professor.
>> Keynesian propagandist economist.
>> Well, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I just had um it's not out yet,
but I just recorded a uh very wonderful
conversation with Lord Skidolski, the
biographer of Canes. Uh and uh we
discuss Canes and Mises and many other
fun things. But we can go in the
Austrian economics and crypto direction
anytime you like.
>> We will get there. But on this point,
it's like, okay, so selling selling the
idea of a hereditary monarch is going to
be feel like a backward step to some
people. Selling the idea of a CEO of a
country is a little bit easier.
>> But what but how does it happen? What
are the guard rails? Who is the board
that can remove them if they suck? Like
what's the reality of it?
>> The reality of that. So So first of all,
the reality is that we normally, you
know, we lar the past unthinkingly.
Yeah. a lot when we think about
politics. And so the first reality is
like how do we get the public to endorse
something that seems crazy to them? And
my answer to that is, have you met the
public? You know, we live in the with
the craziest, most frivolous public
ever. You know, there's a great Black
Mirror episode where they elect a
cartoon character. Have you seen that
one?
>> I God, I've seen nearly every episode. I
don't think I've seen it.
>> It's not very memorable. It's not like
the one where the prime minister [ __ ]
the pig.
>> That's episode one.
>> It's bad. That's the worst black mirror
of all. But I mean,
>> this is kind of real because we all sat
there going, "Well, if I was prime
minister, would I [ __ ] that pig to save
the princess?"
>> Well, it's true. It's true. Kirstar, I
mean, but you know,
>> Kar would probably [ __ ] the pig anyway.
I probably
I'm probably going to go to jail now for
that.
>> Well, just don't go back, you know. Um
Um But uh
>> Yeah, I have to go.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll visit you. I'll
visit you.
>> But back to my point. Back to my point.
>> Yeah. that well back to my question it's
like so the first answer to your
question is actually we live in the most
nihilist we have the most nihilistic and
frivolous public ever and if you look at
basically forget you know the boomers
the silent generation even my own
beloved Gen X you were probably born in
like the late '7s maybe
>> 78
>> 78 73 I love Gen X Gen X power right you
know forget Gen X forget the millennials
let's just focus on the zoomers Y
>> you know and the thing is basically the
zoomers you know if they're in this like
boring world right and there's a red
button on the wall and the red button
says if you press this button
everything will change you know I don't
think anybody but a zoomer will press
the button but a zoomer will be like why
the [ __ ] not anybody but a zoomer will
be like well it could get much worse
>> what what what year zoomer
>> uh I think even the younger zoomers the
zoomers who were like teenagers in uh
you know Zoomer is uh
>> Oh, Connor is you.
>> Yeah, but the later the later Zoomers
the later Zoomers are the most radical,
right? You know,
>> like come on, let's put Connor on the
spot. Connor, you're a Zoomer. You can
press a red button and everything.
>> You press the red button and be like,
"All right, you know,
>> in an instant."
>> In an instant.
>> Why would you press the button?
>> Why not?
>> Why not?
>> Why not? Why not? Right. Why not? Why
not? But and and so when we think of
democracy, we think of like this New
England town hall with people like how
do we establish a more perfect union for
ourselves and our posterity and like the
Zoomer like vibe is like why not, right?
You know, and so actually the key to
basically sort of and in a real regime
change, here's the thing about a real
regime change in a real regime change
everyone's life changes. you know, if
you were in in in, you know, East
Germany in 1985 and 1995, you had a
different life. Your life was different,
right? And, you know, the idea of having
an election, having some event, because
all of this has to happen through
through elections,
>> does it?
>> Yes. Well,
>> pretty much yes, it does. And I'll
explain why in a second. It does
>> not happen through civil war.
>> No. No, it can't. And that's really the
most disturbing fact. It can't happen
through civil war. It can happen through
civil war because when you look at
societies that were actually capable of
civil war, they had something that we
don't have, which is balls. They had men
who had all been in fights. How many
fist fights have you been in? How many
fist fights?
>> Not recent, but I had a lot when I was
younger.
>> Yeah, maybe when you were younger, but
like you know,
>> there were no camera phones recording
you.
>> There were no camera phones recording.
New Zoomers, not so much. You know, like
if you look at
>> what
>> what you mean
>> depends on your perspective, you know.
Um um and and but the thing is
fundamentally we are one of the most
nonviolent and most least selfviolently
organizing populations in history. If
you look for example at the you know in
France they had a thing right before co
remember the gile the yellow jackets in
France.
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Yeah. They were basically like they had
studied democracy, you know, it's okay
if you use quote mark. They studied
democracy in school and they knew that
the way you change the government of
France is to get a lot of people
together in Paris and have them make a
lot of noise. And they got together. It
was like waving the orange paddles for
the cargo cult. They got together in
Paris. They had this brilliant idea that
every French driver, as I discovered
when I when I fell asleep on the wheel
in France, uh, every French driver has
to have a yellow vest in their car. And
they're like, "Uniforms." I'm like,
who's had this idea before, right? You
know,
>> there's more than that. You have to have
a warning sign in the back.
>> Yeah.
>> But they only used the yellow vest,
right? You know, because it was an
improvised uniform and suddenly a mob
became an army, which is what happens
when you wear a uniform. A mob became an
army and they're like, "We have this
army of people and we're going to get
together in Paris and things are going
to change." And they got together in
Paris and nothing happened. And they're
like, "All right, that was act one.
We're going to come back for act two
next weekend." And I think they got up
to like act 50 or something and then co
happened and everybody called the whole
thing off, right? You know, and that's
why basically you can't have political
change through like mass movements is
that the energy just isn't there and
hasn't been there for a long time. You
know, if you look at England 500 years
ago,
>> hold on. But that's that's a nonviolent
civil war. Like if a civil war happens
here in the US, like Republicans are
getting their guns out.
>> No, no, no, no, no, no. None of these
people has ever shot at a human being.
Um, you know, none of them knows how to
shoot at a human being. The Tea Party in
America, exactly the same thing. You got
a lot of people together. You know what?
They didn't even litter.
>> Okay. So,
>> the leftists at least litter. They
didn't even litter.
>> So, it's a better example of of where
this has happened and could happen. Is
is Boule a good example? Uh Boueti is a
better example because Boulli was
elected through the normal electoral
process and then he carried out what in
you know it's Spanish is called an alto
gulp which means an auto coup.
>> Yeah.
>> Um and so
>> change the rules a bit.
>> He was elect as did our you know the
much revered American President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt
>> and I took a quote from that by the way.
Where is the one? I mean, I took a few.
Uh, but in the event that Congress shall
fail to take one of these two causes,
and in the event that the national
emergency is still critical, I shall not
evade the clear cause of duty that will
then confront me. I shall ask Congress
for one of the remaining instrument to
meet the crisis executive power.
>> Executive power
>> to wage war
>> to wage a war
>> against the emergency as the great as
the power would be given to me if it in
fact invaded by a foreign. So he said
like, "Give me the power. [ __ ] you. I'm
going to do it anyway.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Basically, right? He's like,
"Give me the barrier." And he's like the
most revered president in American
history by Democrats and Republicans
alike today, right? And so, you know,
the idea that this is like and he
basically rules as a dictator for life,
more or less.
>> Yeah. Yeah. A little issues. He's not
100% Hitler. He's like 70% Hitler. And
of course, he doesn't kill the Jews. He
has that for that. Although he does
reject every opportunity to save the
Jews, you know. Um you know for example
there's something um the uh I don't know
great but uh very successful um novelist
Michael Chabon has a book that was
written in the 80s called the Yiddish
policeman's union that is set in an
alternative world where something called
the Slatterie plan uh was successful.
The Slatterie Plan was a plan by a guy
named Slatterie who worked at the
Department of the Interior who in like
1938 or so proposed, what if we just,
you know, I understand that most
Americans don't like Jews and we don't
want to let in the Jews. Um, but what if
we actually, you know, it was a
brilliant idea like that perafrost idea
I mentioned earlier also involved
Alaska. He's like, "What if we let all
the Jews go to Alaska? Then they won't
bother Americans who are basically
anti-semitic at this time. This is true.
um and we'll just let them into Alaska
and Alaska will be filled with Jews
instead of like polar bears or whatever.
Where's the downside? FDR turns this
down flat. FDR is like, "No, we can't do
that." Because FDR is like basically,
well, like, you know, FDR did not really
like Jews himself and FDR is like, well,
Hitler says he has a Jewish problem. Am
I in the business of solving Hitler's
problems for him? I don't think so.
>> Yeah. And so like actually, you know, to
say that FDR was not involved in
genocide is like uh really no actually
like there's something very dark there.
>> Yeah.
>> And and so like you know and that's that
but yeah you know FDR's first inaugural
is just like all right you elected me
president guess what I'm going to be a
real president. If you look at FDR's
platform that he runs on, he's basically
governs as the opposite of his platform
because the Democrats are America's like
traditional conservative party. Let's
not forget. So if you look at the 1932
Democratic platform, it's like small
government, lower taxes, you know, etc.,
etc. It's a traditional Democratic
platform. That's how that inversion
happens, right? Um, and so he's just
like, all right, there's a crisis. I'm
going to take absolute power. But the
thing is he also had this whole
revolution of the elites behind him.
Remember how I was talking about the
Fabians, the progressive Republicans?
He's like, I'm going to have a
revolution and I'm going to hand power
to this aristocracy, which is ready,
willing, and able to assume power and to
govern and knows exactly what it would
do with it. And you know who is not
quite ready and willing and able to
assume that same level of power despite
popular belief is Silicon Valley.
They've gotten a little closer, but
they're not there yet.
>> Well, it's interesting you should say
that because there is a fracturing of
the elites right now. There is a like a
new wave of elites where someone like
Mark Andre says, "Do you know what? I'm
not going to be with the
>> I don't want to go to those dinner
parties. I don't
>> It's at a very young It's at a very very
young stage. It's much earlier than most
people suppose and it's much more timid
and much more unready to rule than most
people suppose. But it is vaguely it is
the only thing and it's different of
course in time but it is the only thing
that is sort of comparable in any way to
those progressive elites that I was
talking about earlier. But it is a new
sort of like it's like there's a Peter
Teal or there's Mark Andre and there's
your your good mate JD Vad. But I I'm
joking. But but but what I'm saying is
there is a there's a break now.
>> There's a you can you can you can
glimpse something distant, but it sort
of still doesn't know like you know
think about the dog that caught the car.
You know, if someone says to these
people, "All right, you know, uh, we all
surrender, the New York Times
surrenders, uh, you know, whatever.
You're in charge of everything. You
know, you're the publisher of the New
York Times, the president of the United
States, the president of Harvard, you're
in charge of everything. What do you
do?" I'm not sure we really know yet.
And that's actually one of the most
significant problems.
>> But is there like a first mover
advantage where some of these people are
fraction away from the because they're
still elites, whatever they are. They're
still the rich people. Well, they still
did do what the [ __ ] they want, but
there's like this fracture in there like
of people who realize that this
democratic system is failing and if the
dem if the pitchforks come out, they're
in line to be taken. Are they the
brighter people are realizing we need
>> the pitch the pitchforks are a myth? The
pitchforks don't exist. And that is one
of the most disturbing facts about the
world that we live in. But like
>> well, historically they're a myth.
>> No, in the present day they're a myth.
>> The the current pitchfork is is is is a
vote or a tweet.
>> Yes. Yeah.
>> Yes. But literal pitchforks do not
exist.
>> Well, we replaced pitchforks with votes.
>> Yeah. But actually in the past they had
both pitchforks and votes and the threat
was if you ignored the vote then the
pitchfork would come out and now that
threat has become toothless. Yeah.
>> And that is a big reason and that cannot
be changed and it is a big reason why
votes also have become toothless because
you votes used to be a threat of the
pitchforks. You know, in a way, England
500 years ago was more democratic than
England today. Because in England 500
years ago, London 500 years ago, you
know, the mob was, you know, there's no
standing army, the mob is almost
irresistible. It's very problematic. And
so if the London mob like the
apprentices, you rumor runs around the
apprentices that, you know, the Germans
in the steelyard are undercutting
trueborn Englishmen in the wool trade,
well, there's only one solution. let's
get together and kill all the Germans
and they would basically do this you
know they would have promers right you
know and they
>> well the mob now wants to maintain the
system rather than
>> the mob now doesn't have any force like
the last London riots you had first of
all to the extent that anybody riots at
all remember the London riots from 2011
there on South London
>> were were you in them were you uh
>> no they were they were [ __ ] idiots
>> yeah sure and they did not have any
political capacity
that we're not going to storm Whiteall
and establish an alternative government,
you know, and you know, that's an
underclass riot. Also, January 6th,
which was not an underclass riot, which
was a riot of the lower middle classes,
was also not going to storm the capital
and establish an alternative government
and, you know, immediately, you know,
order an armored core to arrest Barack
Obama or something.
>> But, but the mobs we have now, like we
went to London for the Tommy Robinson
free speech march. We went to observe.
We went to see it. And there was every
attempt to keep it as peaceful as
possible. Tommy himself came forward and
said, "Be peaceful. Don't drink. Don't
put on face masks." There was one clash
where they shepherded people to a wrong
place and a bunch of idiots threw some
bottles. It lasted 20 minutes. It wasn't
good. It was a front page of the Daily
Mail of 100,000. The one event is is
like, you know, meanwhile when
>> when the black lives matter right
happened or the Gaza protest happened
like
>> those are those are progovern rights.
Those are progovern things.
>> That's what I'm saying. The mob now the
there is a mob now and it's a pro
government.
>> Okay. So the progovernment mob is
obviously completely irrelevant and just
there to basically torment the people.
The anti-government mob actually has
political potential in theory, but it
has zero capacity for violence. So in
1934 in France for example not to get
all Putin on you but the 1934 in France
there's an event where basically the
French right and there is a number of
sort of quai you know Nazilike armed
forces on the French right including um
you know the quad the few the cross of
iron you know like and these are world
war I veterans huge numbers of them
right these are blood hardened people
they will do anything right and Um you
know they're it's like the jile jang you
know they mass in Paris and then the
leader of the uh the quad the f um
colonel de la rock in incredibly hard
name everything about the naming goes
very hard here colonel dear ro is like
do we storm the presidential palace and
form a new government and colon dear ro
is like no we're peaceful and democratic
and so they all go home right you know
and and like
>> we should we should look at the people
of the pole
>> you know and And that determines the
direction that France goes. And so the
idea that Tommy Robinson, you know, God
bless his heart, uh, is going to storm
Whiteall. You know, if even somebody
throws a bottle, you know, if even
there's like some Yabos with facial
tattoos, you know, Tommy doesn't like it
and nor should he, right? And so
actually the idea that violence can save
you in any way, shape or form or that
violence can you know defeat these
governments you know has always been a
myth in a way actually you know an
intact state can always resist any level
of violence and intact if the state at
the time of the storming of the Bastile
or the Russian revolution had been
healthy the storming of the winter
palace these things never would have
happened and So this is why
>> because of western because we're western
nation there's a western nation we've
just seen it in the poll
>> we've been domesticated we've been
castrated we've been like you know de in
a way the the removal of violence from
the daily life of like ordinary people
is just like is actually a
dehumanization. If you were an
Elizabethan aristocrat you were expected
to be able to kill people with a sword.
It was like a totally normal thing,
right? You know, and if you were like a
commoner, it was just like I mean the
murder rates are like very high at this
time, right? You know, you are rough
rough people. And the reason that
democracy literal democracy comes into
existence is that is a formalization of
this mob power. Just as monarchy is a
kind of formalization of the influence
of like a great military leader. And
when that force vanishes, the power
becomes symbolic. And this is why, you
know, we have all of this symbolism of
democracy today. But actually, because
there is no potential of for mob
violence, fundamentally the government
does not have to listen to the people.
And this is why you see this kind of
turbulent opposition to like mass
migration in England today. And you
know, um, Shabbana Mimmude, he feels
free to just totally ignore it because
like, what can they do to her? They
can't do anything to her. What can Tommy
Robinson do to Shabbana Mimmude?
Nothing, right? He might as well be a
gnat in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil
as far as Shabbana Mammud is concerned.
Now, Nigel Farage,
that's a different story, right? And
that's why basically that is why
actually in this sort of moment the
question of do you start winning
elections and then actually doing the
FDR thing of saying we won the election
so we're actually in charge of the
government like whoa you won the
election but that doesn't mean you're in
charge of the government like right you
know
>> we have the civil service for that
>> yeah we have the civil so Humphrey
Applebee is like yes minister very good
you know like yes you're in charge of
the government right you know and uh you
know and And um you know, but an accent
more plumby than any any I could ever
emulate, right? You know, and and um the
accents. I love British accents. My
gosh. You know, and especially the high
tone, you know, RP ones. Does anyone
still speak RP? Can you emulate ERP
even?
>> I don't know what you mean by RP.
>> Receive pronunciation the Queen's
English talking like Queen Elizabeth II
in like 1960.
>> Uh I don't think I could,
>> but you know what it would sound like if
you tried. Um um I don't want to make an
attempt.
>> The queen,
>> but what I will say is that my I think
my podcast career was quite successful
because I had a large American audience
and they respected.
>> They love a British accent.
>> But actually, if you got a little bit
more plumbing, they might respect it
more. You're a little bit like, you
know, is that an estuary accent that we
got going on here? Well, so so my
Bitcoin podcast did very well in the US
and I definitely accentuated my British
accent a bit more when I learned it was
a uh it was a cheat code.
>> Girls love it.
>> You Well, dude, when I used to travel,
sorry, son. When I used to travel my
podcast in my single days, I would get
to America, my did the description
British.
>> Yeah.
>> Suddenly 6'4.
>> Many such cases, right? Yeah. No, but
the British accent does work. But but
not in Britain because people go, "Oh,
no, he's just a dumbass."
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if but
if but if but if you sounded like an
Eden old boy, uh you know, I think that
still has a certain effect.
>> Yeah. I think so. I don't think the
Jordi the Brahmy some of the other
accents were. But the
>> if you can speak slowly and you know
>> politely and like Sir Humphrey,
>> oh you're so beautiful.
>> Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It does work. Um
um but where were we with that? Okay.
So, look, but I'm going back to the
point really.
>> So, what it's really important is to
basically say we don't have this backup
of overthrowing the government through
violence. We actually need to change the
government by winning elections and the
ability to win elections is slipping
away as basically very survile and
devoted populations are imported. That
is the reality of the political shape of
the moment. You only have a certain
amount of time to win that. So, we got a
three-year window of opportunity
for one, a new party, which looks like
it could be reform, but they then they
really have to be Trump 2 rather than
Trump one. Indeed. Well, no, they have
to be like Trump four or five.
>> Okay. So, straight in there.
>> Yeah. They have to rewrite a lot of the
laws
>> all the way. I would say that, you know,
if you want to, you know, people often
look at sort of a problem with
restricted range. So if you're looking
at, you know, there's a range, there's a
boolean question, a range between 0 and
one. One of the easiest ways to sort of
trap people is to, you know, get them of
thinking of 0.1 is one or 0.01 is one.
And then when they get to 0.01, they're
like, I won. No, actually like you're
just, you know, just zoomed in a little
too much. Straight to one. And straight
to one, there's an excellent there's a
very easy way to define straight to one
that is very satisfactory
that you know cannot be uh argued easily
against by our friend the lib. And that
is to say that actually the power the
level of sovereignty that you need to
hand to prime minister Farage is
essentially the level of power that was
held by Allied military government in
Germany in June 1945.
