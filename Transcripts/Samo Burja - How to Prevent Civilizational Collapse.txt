as soon as a society loses this ability
to advance a living tradition of
knowledge and is merely preserving just
the pattern of behavior it's like a
timer you're just like how long can you
stay off entropy exactly and that is a
doomed battle what does it matter if we
have something called a university if a
truly unusual thinker with a deep
interest and knowledge cannot make a
career doing unexplainable things for
unexplainable reasons and occasionally
showing up with a miracle maybe in our
Quest
to make knowledge legible too early we
sometimes destroy what makes it viable
Hello friends and welcome to the win-win
podcast today I'm speaking to Sam buer
Sam is a political analyst historian and
sociologist he's both a researcher at
the long Nile foundation and the founder
of bismar analysis A consulting firm
that gathers in-depth Intelligence on
the political and institutional
landscape of society but he's probably
best known for his writing particularly
on the rise and fall of civilizations a
topic which dominates a large part of
our conversation today and more
specifically what lessons we can draw
from their collapse about our current
society's issues the nature of power the
importance of social Technologies how to
spot signs of institutional rot and the
importance of great Founders even in
today's modern age lots of Juicy stuff
let's dig in
[Music]
so s you are I mean you're many things
you're a sociologist a historian uh
political analyst but I think the area
of your work that I find Most
Fascinating is your study of how
previous civilizations collapse so I'm
I'm curious to hear any common threads
between all the different types of
civilizational collapses and are there
any commonalities that you've noticed
well uh first off I have to acknowledge
that there are in fact many theorists of
civilizational collapse and many people
have written about this uh actually for
centuries uh there are a few favorite
theories and we could dive into all of
those but if I give my account and sort
of my summary on top of much that's
happened is that I think the key
difficulties of most societies are
sociopolitical in the sense that perhaps
most societies for most of human history
have been literal pyramid schemes not
just in the sense that say a Bronze Age
civilization might build some pyramids
but in the sense that it requires
constant growth and novel inputs right
novel inputs of resources novel inputs
of Manpower um novel um you know
honestly some times novel infusions of
knowledge one of the more interesting
aspects to me is that in our
civilization uh let's call this Western
Civilization though one could argue for
example that around the 1880s the sort
of old western civilization gave way to
a new type of industrial and scientific
civilization one could make that
argument but let's say that there's
continuity we tend to believe so much in
progress either progress is good or
progress is bad it's like leading us to
ruin and we don't pay very much
attention to the long epochs of History
where knowledge actually regresses it's
not even just there is a sudden collapse
but you might have centuries of stasis
or slowly abandoning various
technologies that previously were
economical and under changed conditions
are no longer reasonable to sustain uh
you know you stop building aqueducts not
because the Germanic Invaders are always
burning them down you stop building
aqueducts because your cities have
emptied out and they have a fraction of
the wealth and the population that they
used to so it is completely uneconomical
to build novel structures like that and
once you haven't built one in a 100 or
200 years well you don't know how to
build one right all technology lives in
socioeconomic niches where it's
sustained by humans right human human
hands human labor and maybe eventually
we will get to the point of
self-sustaining technology if I were
being playful I would say that
domesticated plants and animals are the
closest we have to self-sustaining
technology that's truly a ratchet right
if a new breed of horse is domesticated
right and for some reason you know our
civilization stops using horses a few of
them are likely still to escape and then
whatever wild type of horse like say in
Australia right the Brumby or in North
America I think we even had camels
Escape at some point and uh New Mexico
and created a wild population that
biological organism will persist
whatever Innovations we bred into it for
long after our society is gone so you're
pointing at that one of the key drivers
of civilizational collapse is loss of
knowledge so what are the main
mechanisms of of this knowledge loss
like for example you you mentioned the
aqueducts in
Rome you seem to be hinting something
that it it's like is it that knowledge
you you need to find a way to keep
knowledge passing down from generation
to generation and is it because they
didn't have sufficient technology to to
write that knowledge down or is there a
different flavor of knowledge that's
being lost I would say that nearly all
of our knowledge is actually tacit and
Unwritten knowledge what do you mean by
tet
procedural uh almost a matter of habit
if if we were to attempt to write down
the procedure used at a tsmc chip Fab
for the manufacturer of a particular set
of uh you know
chips I'm sure we could write very long
books they would be very helpful yet you
would still need experts with actual
experience to run the procedure
successfully no matter how much you
document there's always more left to
document and carrying out those
operations with high reliability and
having a functional division of labor
and human specialization which mind you
all Technologies require extensive human
specialization I don't know of any
technology that does not require
extensive human
specialization uh this is by the way
even true of so-called Stone Age
societies right so if you look at the
Neolithic or even the Paleolithic you
will have archaeological evidence of
long-distance trade where people will
dig up a particularly useful Rock
deposit uh make work shops to to make
little Flint knives and then those Flint
knives might find their way two or 300
miles away being traded by One Tribe to
the other so when we think of uh you
know globalization in a way maybe truly
started in the Stone Age and even in the
Stone Age to produce the stone axes
Spears tips uh Pottery extensive
specialization was already required
right so again so what does it mean to
require specialization for a piece of
technology uh to function you've heard
the argument that you know no one knows
how to make a pencil right and you know
this is usually introduced as like a
metaphor about the market but it goes to
non-market societies too it is this
clear argument the Deep specialization
between different humans is needed what
does this mean it means that every piece
of technology is secretly also a
coordination problem I mean arguably
Boeing is learning this as we speak with
uh doors falling off of their planes um
I don't expect this is the end of
commercial air travel though it might be
an early stage in the end of Boeing uh
as a particular company um and if you
know Boeing was the only company in the
world if there wasn't an Airbus and you
know for a variety of reasons new
competitors could not enter the market
we very well might live to see a
civilization that abandons Mass
commercial air travel consider the
scenario the following
scenario drones displace human piloted
aircraft as the main mode of air
power thereby making the difference
between a military plane and a
commercial passenger plane much greater
right you no longer have this like dual
use nature of the Aerospace industry
meaning major countries no longer
subsidize their Aerospace industry
including France United States maybe
Russia add to this perhaps a greater
emphasis on reducing CO2
emissions so we might have a situation
where the aircraft developing new manned
aircraft is super expensive there's no
defense reason to do it because there's
no defense reason to do it there's no
investment in improving it we're just
stuck with the 737 forever and fuel
costs let's say maybe go up and then as
slowly the airlines start failing and we
take fewer and fewer flights a narrative
emerges well we are we're not regressing
technology Al you see uh in this one
domain we are becoming more
environmentally conscious and we're
saving so many tons of CO2 actually it's
not a defeat that a million people fewer
travel over the air this year than last
year it's a victory because think of all
of the tons of CO2 we didn't emit so one
thing that very much does happen in most
declining societies is a reframing of a
defeat as a victory fulfilling that
socioeconomic niche that I I alluded to
earlier very abstract concept but Elites
in all Societies in all places have
Victory narratives why because the
victory narrative sustains paying action
today with coin from the future right it
sustains the pyramid scheme even if
ultimately say you know the peasants or
the middle class or even the lower
aristocracy are the ones left you know
paying the bill because the next stage
of the pyramid scheme never comes to be
um and I think that historically what
might be an example of this well your
Society might find itself in a very
serious War you might find yourself in a
struggle between I don't know the high
German nobility and the Holy Roman
Emperor and in that situation something
like the Protestant Reformation where
you go in and you seize the gold from
the churches well you're not seizing
gold from the churches to fund your
Rebellion against the emperor that would
be a bit you know that'll be a negative
sign it's a positive sign we've now
realized the honor God we don't need
these golden altars at all
so we always have a reason for
confiscation of resources and we always
have a reason for the confiscation of
human labor and the reason always is
presented as a progression a new
Evolution so okay we're reforming back
to true Christianity and true
Christianity means that I get all of the
land of the monasteries right Henry d8
certainly thought so also that you know
I get any divorce want Henry de also
thought so and it's and and it's more of
an auster aesthetic because like PR PR
isn't a very drab and so on whereas
Catholicism was very golden golden
churches and very ornate so it's
reframed as like no we we're we're
closer to God but really it was done for
economic reasons is what you're saying
yes and the tax burden of say peasants
in Northern Germany and Southern Germany
it was the same so the whole argument
that you know if one is less sympathetic
to relig religion there certainly
arguments against religion might be that
oh isn't it terrible that the churches
are so ornate and The Peasants are so
poor well the poverty of the peasants
was almost uncorrelated to the wealth of
the churches because a different
extractive class filled that Niche
almost fully right where the ultimate
tax burden was about the same actually
um there's still arguments of course for
protestantism I'm just noting that say
the uh christianization of the Roman
Empire
went along very similar lines State
Property including the Pagan temples
right you know Temple to Jupiter Optimus
Maximus all that beautiful
gold well once we convert to
Christianity that is all part of my War
chest that is all part of the Imperial
Treasury and can be used for defense or
other public works so I do think that
there is this very much um pattern where
a social reform that simplify society
which might be necessary in important
ways uh can be used to to fund or
support almost any kind of effort and
again the the the intentional
recycling of late Antiquities
architectural and artistic patrimony uh
that actually was the main mechanism of
the destruction of Roman cities it was
not so much a till Dean burning down a
city it was the Romans themselves
recycling old buildings for building
material and melting down Bronze Statues
to pay coin for the soldiers so what was
the specific things or set of things
that precipitated that pushed them into
doing that was it because you mentioned
that like there were fewer people in the
cities was it so it was a kind of
demographic
collapse I think that there is a
substantial amount of demographic
collapse ongoing in the Western Roman
Empire in the Eastern Roman Empire less
so
uh and the evidence for this is
significant there are historians who
have tried to argue uh that there was
not that much of a population collapse
but honestly their arguments are fairly
weak we have decent numbers for
population of cities where the urban
landscape shrinks generation after
generation meanwhile the evidence of
let's say higher density of habitation
in the countryside is very scanned so
the obvious conclusion is the population
is dropping uh this is hardly for Rome
it's not unique even for the modern
world actually for nearly any point in
the last 9,000 years of human history
cities have always been population syns
people move into a city they work in a
city they usually love life in the city
almost any era you read people
experience entering a city as Liberation
right they find cities very socially
stimulating right I think we find them
addicting as anyone who has friends who
ever lived in New York knows it's sort
of like a toxic ex they never get over
it they never get over the experience of
living in a truly dynamic city um and
they will always bring it up somewhere
or another right uh the same was true of
ER or Uruk in ancient Samaria if you
read uh the Epic of Gilgamesh for
example one of the oldest texts we have
you have this you know a wild man
inkyu who is uh you know out there
happily in the in in the forests hunting
animals and eventually he falls uh you
know there's a lady that comes seek him
out on behalf of a dream like a temple
Priestess um they have a bunch of sex
and then the animals just don't like how
he smells so the poor guy has to go to
the city in the city he gets completely
wasted on beer he gets into pointless
fights and then at one point the king of
the city who kind of arranged for him to
be brought in the city in the first
place notices him he's like wow you have
Marshall Valor you should be my
bodyguard and then they go on these fun
Bromance adventures and seek morality
and all of that but if we read under the
surface what is it talking about it's
talking about oh you go to the city you
might become an alcoholic you're going
to be a menace but you kind of like
living in the city and hunting just
seems so unappealing like the hunter
gatherer lifestyle even if you were
wealthier in some way just starts being
super unappealing and and uh there are
you know less fictional accounts where
the samarians are sort of like looking
down on the recent arrivals into their
cities who are all of these other
peoples who are working in the cities
and they're like you can't even write
your name down okay you're like not
really my equal I'm literate you're just
here to do some menial labor and I think
it's very telling that that was already
a basic civilizational Dynamic 7,000
years ago 6,000 years ago and we could
transport this story almost anywhere
19th century uh Britain uh 16th uh
Century China uh 1st Century Rome what
role did indigenous knowledge loss play
in some of these civilizations was while
I was researching this I was reading
about um I didn't realize like just to
the extent how much knowledge we've lost
like the uh the terror Preta soils if
you familiar with those yes in South
America yeah in the Amazon there the
there are these very dark incredibly
fertile soils that are not actually
naturally occurring um and seem like
they from around 400 years BC uh
indigenous cultures were mixing charcoal
and bone meal um and compost and so on
into these otherwise very infertile
soils around the Amazon and making it so
that you could actually settle and then
when um the you know the Spanish
colonizers came along that it broke up
the indigenous cultures sufficient such
that the knowledge of how to make those
soils was supposedly lost there's an
argument that the introduction of
disease caused a population collapse
which caused some of these areas to be
abandoned however I would um slightly I
would note that civilizations in the new
world had collapsed long before the
Spanish as well right the M civilization
essentially ended long before the
Spanish conquest of the new world right
and uh you know there been many studies
recently where what they do is they fly
uh drones over the jungle and the drones
use lidar basically laser radar to a
peak under the jungle canopy and what
they found was these vast vast sites
something like 20,000 sites of various
cities of great size and this has caused
historians to revise upward the total
population uh of Mayan civilization
Mayan cities from uh these uh early
centuries ad so this is sometimes
literally a thousand years before the
Spanish arrive I think that the kind of
agricultural collapse that we might see
in say South and Central America caused
by the introduction of European diseases
and also you know Conquest rather old
world diseases uh that's probably
happened before uh sometimes just to
internal developments the Aztecs
themselves have a legend essentially
that they came up from the north maybe
from here in uh Texas or new new new New
Mexico or Arizona and invaded previous
societies uh setting up their you know
Priestly system with uh you know the
human sacrifice pyramid once again a
pyramid scheme where you extort the the
other tribes for your human tribute that
sustains kind of your theocracy uh in
place uh and the old world has analogues
as well I mentioned earlier the
samarians right when uh the Semitic
peoples uh the Babylonians and so on
first arrive into Mesopotamia modern day
Iraq they're basically totally
barbarians as well they're like um
they're sort of these uh uh pastoralist
people that barely understand like the
concept of living in a city and all of
the big cities are essentially abandoned
this is around 2,000 BC most of the big
cities are abandoned and
people pick up the titles of oh I'm the
great king of ER and then what you can
tell that this title is kind of fake is
because the great king of er used to
have an army of 5,000 people and then
you have this guy bragging with clearly
a not very educated scribe because the
Sumerian text is kind of bad about
having aund guys and they like wait the
scale of your Society has decreased
massively but you still put on HS and
pretensions of something greater and in
that period a large chunk of Mesopotamia
became basically grazing ground so when
you think about you know nomatic horse
peoples and around 1,000 ad you know
rumaging through Eurasia uh sort of
toppling societies stuff like that has
happened before agriculture is adopted
and abandoned uh many times through
human history what role does inst do the
institutions of a civilization play
nearly all
institutions are these very deeply
inherited and you know developed
patterns of human behavior right they
are in a way an instantiation of social
technology which we could contrast with
material technology right I earlier
pointed out that say you know a 737 or a
tsmc chip Fab are as much uh coord Feats
of coordination as they are Feats of raw
technical knowledge that already shows
that to run to make such products you
always have to have concrete systems of
human organization supporting them so
institutions have to be varied because
the needs of society are very varied and
what is necessary to maintain a city or
an industrial base of a modern kind or
an agricultural civilization of you know
some of the types we've discussed so far
uh those needs are very varied
institutions
often persist and outlive even a
concrete civilization so perhaps a
useful metaphor might be that
institutions are sort of the trees and
the civilization is the
forest uh you know you might inherit a
Roman system of law uh even if you say
don't inherit Roman religion or if you
don't inherit Roman urban life uh but
clearly by the time you're talking about
Charlemagne and you know Frank this is a
very different society and a different
civilization uh than you know the the
Roman senate and state would have been
at 200
BC so I think institutions can be
considered almost sort of these units of
social
organization and they are very
frequently copied and very frequently
renovated and introducing a new type of
institution into a society can radically
transform it I think this is one of the
reasons that often the greatest periods
of civilizational flourishing is when
different civilizations meet and one
institution is introduced from a
radically different selective
environment different mtic selective
environment different political
environment and finds a productive Niche
and thrives in that way uh you know
honestly the organization of say the
Japanese economy politics and Society
after Magi restoration might be like a
wonderful example of this where Japanese
Society is nearly completely transformed
and becomes economically extremely
productive at the end of the 19th
century very quickly coming to rival uh
the European powers that at first seemed
set to colonize Japan as they had so
many other uh societies that they
encountered what role does the problem
of succession play presumably when
you've got these big institutions
whether they're corporations or legal
structures if they were created by a
powerful person when that person is
dying or or you know getting old
retiring you need to have a way to
succeed them so
is was that a common theme throughout
history or is that more of a modern
problem I think that is always been of
course a problem right the uh transfer
of very deep expertise personto person
you know we can break down the
succession problem into almost two
components right there's a knowledge
succession problem and then there's a
power succession problem where a
knowledge succession problem is pretty
straightforward you have a master of
their craft or a great legal mind or a
great
naturalist
and they uh come to develop deep
expertise the course of their life new
to the quirks of our biology and what
seems to be the biology of most life on
Earth uh this expertise this
crystallized intelligence that you've
painstakingly built through your life
that allow you to do really remarkable
maybe Feats of engineering or you know
have a thorough deep understanding of
the legal code in your Society or
anything like that all of it that allows
you to function very well actually even
as perhaps your uh fluid intelligence
decreases through the course of your
life so even as nominally your IQ is
dropping your competence is going up
right finding a replacement for that
very hard and people intuitively
understand that right some past
societies focused on a kind of Master
Apprentice relationship where you would
become someone's apprentice and you sort
of Shadow them at their job and work a
very long time basically providing some
amount of free labor to do more and more
of their job and the payout in a way
wasn't so much Equity or salary the
payout was oh you get to get the
Master's position eventually and ideally
you have recreated or matched every sort
of aspect of that uh that job today we
might see a little bit of this also
still in the academic context where
having uh you know a great Doral adviser
is still very much prized because
everyone understands that the business
of science is still a matter of tcid
knowledge in fact if we went to a room
of scientists right now and quiz them
pull them on on what is their theory of
the scientific process I claim you're
not going to get a single answer I think
you're going to get a diversity of
answers and that really illustrates that
perhaps even in our society the true
business of science Still Remains a
practice rather than a rigorous body of
theory that we apply in all
circumstances and that perhaps we first
developed the practice of science and
only later in the 20th century which I'm
sure you agree is well into the
Scientific Revolution that we start
really deeply debating the theory of
wait why does all of this stuff even
work right and one way to think about
this is that in so many domains of Our
Lives what we once we can put something
into words rigorously or into any sort
of formal notation say mathematics would
I think be conceptually very similar uh
the business of knowledge transfer
becomes easier but it also suggests that
whatever field of inquiry existed there
has been deeply exhausted like once you
can fully systematize something there's
actually not much left to discover like
in physics today you know if I were to
study the solar system and try to get
insights into gravity with enough
resources I'm sure we could eek out a
little bit more but not that much more
and all that low hanging fruit has been
exactly it's like the orbit of mercury
is already figured out we figured out
all the like planets and stuff and you
know three body problem Etc you're not
going to figure that out
not through not through a a telescope
right watching the movement of Jupiter's
moons or whatever which you know maybe
with AI Sims and such yeah yeah May Sim
Sim plus AI what could uh maybe predict
it a little B exactly exactly but but
the point I'm making here is that in a
way maybe the most important function of
knowledge succession and the succession
of tacid knowledge is on the very
frontiers of achievement so it's not so
much about preserving our ability to
have like a jet plane fly or preserving
our ability to like you know make chips
in a t tsmc chip Fab it might be our
ability to innovate and make completely
new kinds of chips or completely new
kinds of aircraft and in a way once
societies lose that due to I think
actually a failure of tacid knowledge
transfer there's this kind of a almost
intellectual dark matter where you can
prove that this sort of intellectual
content must exist but it's very
difficult to describe and account for
all of it right oh I see so like I'm
just trying to figure the metaphor
because like
with in physics dark matter is like oh
okay this these galaxies are spinning
this fast they should be flying apart
but they don't but they don't so that
implies there must be some hidden mass
that we can't phys you know we can't
actually detect but it should be there
and you're saying there's this there's
this knowledge holding our institutions
together even though we we can't clearly
pinpoint what it is like these things
should have fallen apart long ago so
there's some kind of like in almost like
an intellectual gravity that is enabling
us to coordinate and keep these things
going exactly if every piece of
technology is a coordination problem you
look at all the coordination mechanisms
you can explicate and systematize I bet
we don't know all of them yet I think
we're actually pretty bad at figuring
out human behavior on a deep way and
once we do I'm sure that'll be a golden
age in its own right that seems
definitely enough for me to say in the
big picture that would be a totally
different civilization where we truly
scientifically understood the human
being I think that's what people were
hoping for in 1910 or 20 if you read
either the Utopias or the dystopias of
that period uh people were so excited
about Freudian psychology because they
assumed this would be a total revolution
of humanity turned out to be less than a
total Revolution right but you can
understand their enthusiasm perhaps or
uh the enthusiasm for evolutionary
psychology which I think still holds
some potential in the 2010s I will
remember this feeling of excitement
we're about to figure out the human
being and who knows how our society will
change how marriage will change property
will change how our ability to manage
human violence would change and and all
of this uh but before you know we go too
far a field from the initial question I
think that as soon as a society loses
this ability to advance a living
tradition of knowledge and is merely
preserving just the pattern of behavior
that produced the previous thing it's
like a timer it's like your body is uh
has stopped making new skin cells right
right like I'm sure the you're just
you're just like how long can you save
off entropy exactly and that is a doomed
battle like you can fight it for a very
long time like maybe the aqueducts and
say I don't know Constantinople in 300
or 400 or 600 AD maybe those still work
but at some point Constantinople is the
only city that has over a million people
in your rump of a Roman Empire right and
Rome and the 6th Century ad has 70,000
people and goats Grazing In Coliseum uh
it doesn't matter if you're really
dedicated to preserving the heritage of
your city in fact late Roman emperors
would sometimes put uh laws in place
against people pillaging old abandoned
buildings for building material people
did that anyway of course that's it's a
losing battle and
metaphorically you know what does it
matter if we have something called a
university if a truly
unusual uh thinker with a deep interest
and knowledge cannot make a career doing
unexplained things for unexplainable
reasons and occasionally showing up with
a miracle I feel like maybe in our quest
to make knowledge legible too early we
sometimes destroy what makes it viable
we try to solve the succession problem
through written tests as if for example
uh the many Chinese dynasties like the
Ming Dynasty had not attempted to do
this when Europeans encountered uh
Confucian education they were first
immensely impressed because seemed very
close to their ideals if you read 18th
century Europeans they find immensely
inspiring the Confucian educational
system people like voler hold it up as
an example of a rational civilization a
wealthy civilization in the 19th century
they complained about how it's all wrote
memorization I think honestly they're
both right in the 18th century that
system still works very well by the 19th
century that same system as you run its
internal logic and as everyone follows
the incentive gradient and people come
to memorize the like leaked test
results and studying for the test at
first is a great Boon because at first
you're sort of strip mining off Society
for talent and the people who mastered
the test from any layer of society
they're very good at mastering anything
really they're just very smart people
but once that process has been running
for a few
Generations I I actually think it's
inevitable that the imperial exam or the
civil service exam or let's say the
entry interview you know the acceptance
interview for Harvard position become a
becomes a farce becomes something where
maybe I don't know your entire High
School experience is choreographed to
look good at that one interview at an IV
league university I think we're already
there yeah we're almost certainly there
we are certainly there and I think we
were not there 100 years ago and we were
not there 50 years ago okay so what what
are some other signs that you've noticed
that suggest that we are starting to
mirror some of these problems well I
think that it is very
telling that we have
found a general
disappointment in the rate of advance of
most Technologies outside of let's say
anything related to uh the information
revolution anything related to the AI
Revolution so this is the classic sort
of Peter observation about bits versus
atoms currently the promise is that in
the very near future AI will
revolutionize atams um for now I'm only
seeing it make words it makes words very
well uh makes them definitely at the
level of an a college undergrad but
perhaps that's an indictment of the
college undergrad as much as it is a
Triumph of uh open Ai and anthropic
Engineers right I think that the fact
that we had millions of people right
basically wrote essays essays that can
be statistically predicted
just shows us how How Deeply we
exhausted what was once a deeply
intellectual exercise right the essay
comes from the term to attempt something
right the idea behind an attempt is that
you put into words and put thoughts on
paper that you've never explicitly
examined before who can say that they
truly wrote an essay of that type in
high school or even College I can point
to my in my in all my writing I think
have something like six articles that
truly achieve that level and for many of
the other articles I'm just explaining
what I learned from other sources or
what seems to be the ultimate evaluation
and I think the the the fact that we
were a writing based civilization and
now we're sort of almost laring being a
writing based civilization suggests to
me we have lost huge swaths of tcid
knowledge I would even argue that the
stylistic differences between scientific
papers in 1920 versus 2020 suggests that
we have already lost much of what was
once the practice of science well read
uh a scientific paper from 1910 1920
1930 pick a topic of arbitrary
complexity it can be a quantum mechanics
paper even the style is going to be much
less dry than any modern paper even any
modern paper it's going to be less
formulaic it's going to be much less
formulaic it's going to be very
economical with jargon it's going to be
very um straightforward very precise but
also beautiful why is it beautiful it's
beautiful because it's meant to be read
by human beings not
committees it's beautiful because it is
a remnant of the old peer review which
we have nearly forgotten the old peer
review being hey I trust this person's
intellectual taste I will submit to
their journal and they will decide if
they publish me in their scientific
journal if my work is bad I'll be
embarrassed in front of our scientist
for friends that's old peer review new
peer review in the 20th century is the
nominally meritocratic and rational
committee the problem with the committee
is you must agree with every member of a
committee even if they disagree with
each other so over time this has
produced a very stilted form of writing
and it is a writing that is Dreadful to
read right even if you're super
interested in the subject matter which
means most academic papers are not read
so who are they produced for why are we
producing so many papers well it's hard
to give the government a kpi for the
scientific research it's funding an easy
kpi is oh we have 50 researchers working
this no we have 500 scientists working
on this no we have 5,000 uh phds in
chemistry working on this problem so the
inflation of headcount and you can also
say our department has published so many
papers so many scientific papers and one
point the scientific paper was obviously
a good advancement now let's in social
science for example we had the
replication crisis go through and you
know basically torch entire fields of
knowledge the publication of a paper is
not news anymore it's like not even news
for people in the field right but it is
a requirement to publish papers to
achieve funding and to achieve uh
accreditation right so that this this
hyper production of lowquality
writing where the quality of the writing
itself no longer matters betrays that we
are no longer a writing based
civilization we just believe it's super
legitimate to base Authority and writing
so it sounds like what you're getting at
here is it's a kind of it's like a a
dark amalgam of excessive bureaucracy
and like tyranny of metrics in terms of
optimizing for those Good's law in
everything exactly God heart's law I
mean once an excellent measure becomes a
Target right it ceases to be a good
measure exactly and and it it so
everything has become you know you
before your goal was writing good papers
to do good science and then it's like
okay but now the goal is to just write
papers and and so you're just your your
objective function has like gotten
derailed um and you are and and yeah so
everyone is now sort of Trapped in these
I call them moock traps but these these
kind of social dilemmas where even if
you don't want to be churning out just
paper after paper to get funding if you
don't do it everyone else is going to so
you have to play that game as well you
are stuck in that equilibrium no matter
what you want to do as an individual
unless for example if one were
independently wealthy and very socially
resilient then one could fund any
research they wanted or sustain
themselves but very few people do this
right it's uh one of the reasons I say
admire like uh you know the Steven wolfs
of the world whatever you think of the
scientific Merit of some of his theories
or the
self-presentation uh I actually think he
deserves praise for trying to actually
be a scientist in the way a 19th century
uh scientist would have tried to be a
scientist right uh you know we forget
the the idea of the sort of gentleman
scholar free from worldly Affairs just
trying to figure out the world right and
sometimes having a big ego Isaac Newton
had a big ego that didn't stop anyone
from taking Isaac Newton seriously would
uh Isaac Newton have done well in any
sort of uh you know HR department
interview horrible he would have done
horribly right he he could be positively
nasty it wasn't just like Aspergers
right he could be viciously competitive
and I think we have come
to
deeply disdain the kind of
personality that can actually drive new
ideas I think I think we have put a high
premium on being very well socialized by
which we mean very conflict of on the
surface but perhaps very conflict
oriented below the surface in our
society that energy got to go somewhere
it has to go somewhere in our society
any sort of physical violence of course
is out which sure okay that seems
reasonable uh but even overly harsh
scientific
criticism is met with suspicion why are
you upsetting the apple cart shouldn't
we all be working together as a field
blah blah blah
blah what are we doing are we
collectively preserving class privilege
the class privilege of being an academic
or we trying to discover truth or uh
economic competition trying to do
economic competition for real today will
get you denounced as a ruthless
businessman when it's like really well
all I'm trying to do is make a good
product and you know we are going to try
to drive our competitors out of business
if someone says that in modern corporate
culture they're like what top 4
percentile top 2 percentile disagreeable
among CEOs right maybe top 1% even these
are all of these ways in which uh
of course the fact that all of these
things are punished right physical
violence in intellectual competition
economic competition that of course
suggests there's a lot of hidden
physical violence intellectual uh you
know in intellectual sabotage and
economic sabotage because otherwise who
would be punishing them right so there's
a broader theme I think
of we have focused very much
on eliminating outliers
and we're experiencing kind of
evaporative cooling in society right
where over time we always Lop off the
right and left side of the distribution
or maybe just the right side of like a
gossing distribution and you know not in
a genetic or IQ sense just on on any
sort of trait that we allow people of
you know various positions to have and
over time our sense of how what the
proper social role is gets narrower and
narrower and narrower and we have in the
process of narrowing it cut out huge
chunks of what once made it functional
to be I don't know the member of a of a
of a of a corporation right um a
functioning board today is exotic almost
dangerous almost unprecedented like a
board that practices any oversight over
a company that's that's weird right like
how everyone had a meltdown over the
when the open AI board I mean it's job
is to keep an eye on the CEO and while
none of us really know what actually
went down like
they clearly felt strongly enough that
the C CEO had done something wrong and
they took an action and then the whole
world had a meltdown about it and it's
like that's what a Bor is meant to do so
the fact that that was so
shocking suggests that like something's
going to there we expect a certain level
of um well what do you think like was
that was that a further example of this
or is that actually something against
the trend you know I think all
indicators suggest Sam Alton is an
excellent uh CEO according to most
metrics used in Silicon Valley har
undoubtedly true that that is exactly
within the authority of a board right a
board might be wrong but the fact it's
become so rare to have any sort of board
oversight in a modern corporate body in
Silicon Valley uh even an unusual one
like open AI I think that's concerning
so even if the board was incorrect in
that case right it still suggests we've
lost the social technology of a joint
stock company we've lost the social
technology of a well-governed nonprofit
it means we've lost we've lost that
feedback mechanismic I mean it legally
still exists all of these things exist
on paper as I'm sure you know um the
Roman senate existed on paper long after
it ceased to be relevant right in the
7th Century ad uh in Constantinople you
still had people going around calling
themselves Senators right would they
meet no would they pass laws no on what
stage of this change are we say in our
political institutions I would argue
that the majority of law in the modern
United States is made purely
administratively what is not made
administratively is made through
judicial review and only a small amount
of law is made by Congress itself right
so when people are saying Congress
doesn't do anything yet then turn around
and speak about our democracy that's
very strange I think this will perplex
future historians for much the same
reason we are a bit perplexed that you
know Augustus is calling himself first
citizen rather than just he's obviously
the emperor okay there's the Senate
obviously does matter and everyone knew
the Senate doesn't matter but they drew
legitimacy from long dead institutions
right this is also another thing that
happens over time the maintenance of the
appearance of an institution can become
very vital for the political balance of
a society so you have zombie
institutions going around where we need
someone to fulfill a social role and the
role of a long broken institution is to
stay there and pretend to be in that
social role and you know I could say
quip that uh maybe the modern United
Kingdom is a bureaucracy pretending to
be a democracy pretending to be a
monarchy right where you know any sort
of democratic element when it does have
input it's very unconsidered very
chaotic maybe like brexit and uh you
know whenever any monarchical element
enters it's this very strange
Untouchable thing that however is still
there and will probably still be there
200 years from now I would I would say
that I don't think the UK is pretending
to be a a monarchy anymore like I no one
no one in no Brit thinks that the the
the Monarch actually has any meaningful
power or very few Brits do at least but
I I think they do I do agree with you
that it's at least they still hope and
believe that democracy is legitimate and
and playing out so what when you say
it's a bureaucracy masquerading as a as
a democracy
what are the signs that it is what what
makes you think that it is no longer a
functioning democracy and was there a
particular Tipping Point where you were
like ah okay this is this is where it
switched over when was it last basically
mhh um well I would say that a very
important Point has to be that we all
basically explain away the failures of
elective representatives to Institute
any sort of change in purely personal
terms we always talk about oh the these
politicians are corrupt bad not serious
co-opted by the system and so on yet
obviously anyone who makes it to those
positions always has those
features the system and the whole set of
incentives actively select for a certain
kind of individual to go there but the
pretense we all have is that if the
right individual got in they could still
do things why do we believe that why do
we think that if suddenly you know a
different person came into Parliament or
Congress that they would be able to
organize with other fellow congressmen
or members of parliament and say I don't
know reform the intelligence Community
or reform the Pentagon or even reform
either way the N NHS right in
Britain I think it's very dubious that
they could do that especially in the
very short amount of time they have
available especially with very limited
resources in terms of uh uh even
research capacity like how much research
capacity as to all of these difficult
problems that an elective representative
is supposed to have a crisp opinion on
how much capacity do they have who is
doing that intellectual labor for them
well might be lobbyists might be their
political party if they're a
particularly functional party but
they're certainly not doing it as
individuals so i' put the Tipping Point
around the last time you saw saw a
representative deliberative legislative
body where a speech was given to other
members of the elected body with the
primary intent to change the opinion of
fellow legislators rather than the
general public now here's an interesting
one we're used to debates being a circus
they are there to help you be elected it
is exotic and strange for us to imagine
a body where the elected officials meet
and they try to persuade each other of
points right and actually change
people's minds exactly truly yeah
they're trying to change each other's
minds to converge on a common truth
Converge on a common truth with each of
them being a representative of the
interest interests of their constituents
what I said sounds like Civic 101
because it is and because it's crazy to
point out that's not how it works right
now but the crazier thing is it kind of
did work that way in 1900 1920 I would
say as late as 1960 I think in 19 60 if
you had a persuasive well argued speech
in British Parliament or in Congress
people who at that point were 70 or 60
years old uh who were not in touch with
the incentives of their era they would
probably behave as a real deliberative
body right and I think in the United
States an interesting point is the 1970s
which is when Congress to some extent
attempts to both reign in the president
but also reign in the intelligence
Community uh there's commission hearings
that declassify a bunch of stuff in the
United States after the Vietnam War of
course the impeachment also of Richard
Nixon but that's sort of the last spasm
so if we were looking at us history I
think you know the 1970s are a good Mark
and for the United Kingdom maybe 60s
maybe
70s what role do you think um the sort
of sens making crisis that we are
increasingly getting into could be
playing as well because again you've
talked Al about how succession of
knowledge um the the continuation of
tasset knowledge is so important it feel
you know it's arguably harder to
actually get a clear picture of of the
world now I mean in some ways yes we
we've got more information available
than ever before the world is more
connected but at the same time we've got
uh generative AI that's going to be very
quickly making very convincing
politically sensitive videos if if
people want to you know troll Farms
Etc um and then coupled with the fact
that there's there's all these different
sort of incentives at play to encourage
uh headline you know newspapers to
skew uh skew their headlines in in in in
favor of their existing readership and
so on so it it it feels like we're it's
getting increasingly hard to get an
accurate picture of the world that seems
to only go in One Direction right I
think that absence certain important
counter Trends we are seeing over time
the collapse of our society's capacity
for
collaborative um for for basically
collaborative sense making in this sense
that you describe right we are seeing
over time a breakdown of our ability to
process information collectively so we
used to greatly rely on a relatively
healthy epistemic Commons
we used to rely on many incentives that
kept let's say the quality of the median
book above a certain level or the
quality of a certain broadcast above a
certain level and over time we have
fewer and fewer incentives to make good
faith contributions into the epistemic
commons rather than try to in a variety
of ways capitalize on the epistemic
commons
exactly like we we might want to
increase our ad Revenue we might want to
um you know pursue the our career and
the development of our career even if it
means certain amount of intellectual
dishonesty in an academic
context uh we might make decisions with
regard to algorithmic feeds uh where the
information presented to the user is not
the information that is most useful to
them or best for them but the
information that keeps them checking
their app right so these many small
decisions together produce an erosion of
our common body of knowledge I think one
of the beautiful things about generative
AI so far has been it's I I almost view
it as this like you know very beautiful
last Monument of a great
civilization where you know the global
body of text once you run through it
once you run the sum total of all the
text that's been produced so far you get
a pretty competent undergrad writer
that's how I describe like a chat GPT or
a claw they're actually like balanced
relatively they sometimes make stuff up
but on that they write not too badly and
they're getting better and better being
accurate but in a way they're giving us
the gold standard best answer from this
like Corpus of human writing right I
mean you could argue that it's it's the
models there's still scope for the
models to improve
so yes the Corpus of text is fixed but
the models might improve the models
might improve and get better at
inferring what you really mean Etc or
drawing you know drawing threads of my
claim would be the the quality of the
Corpus of taxt is going to decline right
well especially as as hearing that
because now all the data that is
available I mean probably not all books
let let's be real here not all written
books are now dig have been digitized
yet so there's actually a a large
repository of very high quality text
there the arguably should be fed in um
and that hasn't yet however that's a
onetime game that is a one time game yes
but I mean it should be quite a big step
change but what I've been hearing is
that companies are now looking into
synthetic data and that sets off a lot
of alarm Bells because basically that
okay we've run out of Internet to scrape
let's come up with more synthetic text
with which to train our models further
but it's like isn't that like garbage in
garbage out in a like horrifying
feedback loop I mean again I'm sure
they're thinking about this but it's
it's seems yeah if there's like
a we need better ways of sourcing
meaningful information and knowledge as
as if we're going to be feeding into
these uh into these AIS that are then
going to be useful for us but yeah
that's an interesting way of putting it
as a as a like last Monument I mean it's
a summary right we have written the
spark notes on our civilization and we
can query chat to get the spark notes
version of our civilization tldr did not
read right the tldr of our civilization
is in every answer to every prompt you
might ask of a modern generative Ai and
you know the question is maybe the tldr
is good enough for us to get by but to
contribute to that Corpus to continue
either the scientific or the
philosophical uh written tradition that
doesn't exist and because of that I mean
possibly it's truly obsolete possibly
video uh possibly you know generated AI
processing can substitute all of those
knowledge transfers that used to be
oriented around uh practice that had
written output but I doubt it so for
that reason I expect uh the breakdown of
law right law is perhaps one of the last
remnants where we are a writing based
civilization I talked about the
breakdown of science we could talk about
the breakdown of like uh cultural
instruction through writing uh arguably
this is one funny way in which we are
less Protestant and more uh Catholic so
in the 19th century if you had emotional
problems you would try to read a
insightful novel about the human
condition or you would try to read uh
material to help you regulate your
feelings so like Doki or exactly
something like that yeah uh the novel
was super popular because it was a
psychological Aid we talk about
entertainment but really what we should
be talking about is self-medication with
information so that's why it was super
popular why novels could be even
addicting people talked about addiction
to novels in the 19th century and in the
20th century we discovered that
confession works wonderfully so we
secularized it and we called it therapy
so you have a high status person and
they talk to you about your problems and
you give them some uh you know some
tribute and this relationship is
sustained and so that's my joke right we
went from a a book based civilization
like Protestant to priest based
civilization Catholic confession
secularized this therapy
um so but anyway let's say that our
emotional self-regulation has somewhat
broken whether it's because of new
developments or because old Technologies
just don't work anymore old social
Technologies that's an open question and
then I talked about how economic
competition is considered almost unfair
in a in a deep way right even for
example you know and there are problems
with doing business with China but I
know to myself that Tik Tok definitely
disproved the narrative
that Chinese companies could not make
compelling uh apps for users or
compelling software for users now maybe
we still ban it here in the United
States but I think the fact that Tik Tok
was successful really spooked many
people in uh in Silicon Valley and and
the first impulse wasn't we're going to
build an even better app to displace Tik
talkk the first impulse was well this
comes from a communist country surely
their government has its fingers all
over it let's ban it like that's I I saw
like I had hundreds of conversations
where this was sort of the first impulse
but I mean there was evidence to be fair
that the app has all these like back
doors in it sure do American apps have
all of these back doors supposedly fewer
than Tik Tok they were F they were
finding that it was scraping the your um
your clipboard of your phone for example
copy paste and so on why is the solution
to that not a better American Tik Tok
sure I mean I would argue that there's
reciprocity problem with China China's
banned all the American apps from its
App Store why are we allowing a Chinese
app well not all of them right like
Amazon could operate in China sure but
it's but the point is it's it's banned
all of the social media ones for example
so I I think that unto itself like you
do need to have some degree of
reciprocity I'm not even um arguing that
Tik Tok should not be banned I'm just
saying that we there are signs we are
uncomfortable with economic competition
and there are politically speaking I
think sort of law currently remains this
thing where it's become ever more
loadbearing right the US is an Ever more
lawyer run Society we could joke that
America is a word cell Society if we we
use the kind of dumb uh Meme and in some
ways it's like but by relying more
heavily on law it's it's kind of the
equivalent of running to teacher it is
running to teacher but it also means all
the other systems have broken down
right because it's the last remaining
thing the last remaining thing and then
if ever we have generative AI excelth
law we will have a wonderful period of
cheap and highquality representation for
everyone followed one to two generations
later by a much reduced human legal
tradition so in a way we will fossilize
it well because that service will
displace the economic niche of a
lawyer and eventually the niche the
socioeconomic niche of a Supreme Court
Justice can you imagine Supreme Court
Justice that has not had 60 years of
reasoning in their own head about legal
arguments but in fact has 60 years of
clicking yes on a suggested uh text
horrifying again Lo lost tasic knowledge
exactly and even if it's not the Supreme
Court Justice if it's their clerk that's
same thing same thing really even if
it's their junior research staff and
again the result is sort of like perhaps
eating the epistemic seed corn now
possibly again eventually the AI is just
good enough to be some sort of virtual
person in our world maybe we're
comfortable Outsourcing law to
artificial intelligence but at that
point it's uh it's really not our
civilization anymore and at that point
in a way the enlighten has ended right
the project of the Enlightenment was
supposed to be human reason exploring
Society in re-engineering the systems
and incentives for this kind of the
benefit of all right that was at least
the pretense of that project and all of
these things like representative
government the scientific method um you
know even Market competition and at
other times enlightened Central planning
these were all ideas coming from that
philosophy and we return now to the
Haunted World uh the world where the
machine says no where the machine says
yes and we don't really know who builds
the machines we don't really know
whether they work or not I'm not even
horrified about the potential of an AI
takeoff or AI actually being in charge
I'm horrified of us becoming so
superstitious about our machines that we
develop a uh priesthood of the AI long
before the the a is actually capable of
running our society treating it as an
oracle when it doesn't deserve to be our
minds might use good enough year after
year even if good enough gets worse and
worse right like you can have a very
cheap lowquality good can often displace
you know a higher quality more expensive
good that's okay um but when it comes to
the epistemic commons there's like fewer
and fewer reasons to do a good job and
it's not something you can legislate not
really
I feel like legislation at most is like
putting Band-Aids on like uh this wound
where we're bleeding out uh a
well-maintained Commons that once was
just honestly maintained by people who
inherently cared about intellectual
Integrity right it's hard to remember
but we used to care about intellectual
Integrity in this almost religious way
the important thing as an individual in
an Enlightenment style Society was that
you cultivated these virtues because
this is the means through which the
world gets better so you do it even when
it wasn't economically the best thing to
do when it wasn't the socially best
thing to do you did it because you
basically believe that this is how we
Humanity make the world better and the
step of we will remove this and put this
responsibility on the machine is a very
in a way reasonable one but as soon as
that's done all of these reasons to
maintain your ability to process
information in the world they go away
and the whole like House of Cards
collapses and then you have far fewer
people who have this builtup Machinery
this incentive to do this and I claim
that will feed right back into
diminished manufacturing capacity and
actually slower progress on fundamental
algorithmic breakthroughs like every
time I talk to someone who makes on me a
strong impression that they're going to
drive AI further it's never the Sleek
marketing guy it's always some Israeli
or or ex Soviet mathematician weirdo
that has strange theories of metaphysics
strange theories of math and strange
bets on AI when I meet someone like that
I know that I met someone that might
bring AI forward when I don't think I've
met someone that will bring AI forward
is when they talk about it like it's a
it's a plane delivering
cargo right the literal cargo cult we
are very close to saying that we don't
need to know how to build a much better
artificial intelligence the next model
will deliver the car
it's going to bring us nice things and
we're just going to enjoy
them no no I'm talking here about the
the the cargo Cults where you know the
the assumption is that material goods
come from you know planes with filled
with you as soldiers
right so it sounds like what you're
getting at is there's this kind
of ossification of society the simulacra
of reason is beating out reason at all
levels right at the most elite levels
and the most popular levels so so is
this just an inevitable process is it
like part of the like cycle of every
civilization have there been any that
have broken the way out of this cycle or
at least gotten close to it I think that
a certain loss of particular traditions
of knowledge is probably deeply behind
almost every civilization that's ever
collapsed and the reasons is it is
always outcompeted in a certain
sociopolitical game right so for example
uh you know having an excellent
understanding of the Roman legal code at
one point was an excellent way to
achieve power in the Roman Republic that
becomes obsolete when the correct way to
achieve power is command of a Roman
legion say crossing the rubrica right
that becomes obsoleted when the correct
way uh to win power is no longer not
even being a good military commander but
it is uh winning Court entry games and
assassinating any general that happens
to be too successful we could name
belisarius and you know the Empire of
justinia the Eastern Roman Empire or you
know commanders in you know the 4th
Century ad under Emperor honorius right
who would just kill uh successful
generals because why a successful
General can be a threat to the supreme
power so we we have a certain time in
almost every civilization's history
where particular skill or particular
tradition of knowledge be it military
economic scientific spiritual um you
know uh uh social right Urban uh we
developing it is the best way to achieve
success and recognition of society and
the Tipping Point of diminishing returns
come sooner or later right when the
s-curve is exhausted and at that point
you go from positive sum games to
negative sum games and as soon as your
civilization starts playing negative Su
games that is infectious and spreads
rapidly through an institution if the
best way to succeed in a major
government bureaucracy today is to treat
it in bad faith if the best way to
succeed in the media space is to treat
it in bad faith if the best way to
succeed in Academia is to treat it in
bad faith wow we've what's left right
right and I'm not even I'm not even done
I could go forther right if the best way
to run a startup is to treat it in bad
faith and the best way to do it is to
Hype it up at all times s even if you
know your technical fundamentals are
sketchy then you know maybe we're all
become in Silicon Valley we will all
become Elizabeth Holmes maybe we already
become Elizabeth Holmes right and we
don't even know it because who would
point it out right it's just so default
it is very default and that's why I
think that how to break out of that as a
civilization well sometimes you can take
very Extreme Measures which I think can
prolong the existence of a society right
the creation of a completely new city
that comes to be a new Elite Center is
surprisingly effective why well human
beings are biased against moving most
Roman noble families did not want to
follow Constantine and his weird bunch
of religious freaks out into a random
Greek city formerly Byzantium then
Constantinople yet even 50 or 100 years
ago they found themselves radically
disempowered compared to the new uh
Senate that was set up there was a
separate Senate set up in Constantinople
and a new military apparatus and a new
taxation apparatus focused on the
Eastern provinces and of course the
Pagan state-backed religion gave way to
the Christian state-backed religion so
that was a transfer of power there there
wasn't a direct fight there was just
this sudden like change of where
coordination happens I think cities need
to be understood as like physical
embodiments instantiations incarnations
of coordination which street you live on
shockingly important which offices are
close to each other shockingly important
when the US was like structured a bit
more honestly there was a you know there
was a department of War rather a
Department of Defense and it was in the
same building as the state department I
guarantee you if your generals and
diplomats run into each other in the
hallway you will be in fewer stupid Wars
as soon as you physically separate them
to opposite sides of a river or opposite
cities the left hand doesn't know what
the right hand is doing and actually you
might have basically exiled someone to a
place of
irrelevance uh it's not just you know
Roman history that has this phenomena Uh
Russian history has this phenomena when
the Zars wanted to be absolutist in
Russia and have great power over the
high nobility they moved out of Moscow
to St Petersburg leaving the Moscow
nobility behind and
irrelevant so I think I would be very
optimistic if any major Western Country
today created a new capital with a new
University with a new special economic
zone I think that would be extremely
optimistic because that would mean that
the old negative sum institutions are
left to play their negative sum game
which is self- marginalizing and you
immediately are starting something that
at least locally in that City can be a
positive sum game a new flower blooming
yeah I mean this Maps very closely onto
what mot Wade um who was a recent guest
was talking about she
is trying to get these she calls them
Charter cities and presumably this is
are you referring to literally like
building a new city from scratch or is
it like repurposing a new city and
saying look we're going to try out a new
set of laws honestly it's it's good to
have a uh New City from almost from
scratch though it can be an existing
City if a completely new industry is
instantiated there any potential ones in
the US do you think that would could fit
that bill I think the United States is
um too calcified no no no I think I
think it's actually fairly lucky as far
as Western Country go I think there the
demand for urbanization here outstrips
Supply there's still like 50 to 100
million Americans that if they could
make move to a big city and have a high
paying job would happily do so uh I
claim this is no longer true of say
Italy or Spain right the countrysides
already emptied out the second tier
cities are emptied out slowly even the
first tier cities will start to empty
out say like Madrid uh or in Catalonia
or Milan or whatever empty out to where
though just population Decline and on
also to even higher tier cities right
why live in Madrid if you can live in
Brussels if you can live in Brussels why
live in Brussels if you can live in
London and why live in London if you can
live in San Francisco or New York or
Texas right so the the other method
short of creating new cities which I
think is a very it's it very much gives
you like a sort of a societal reset uh
the other the other possibility is uh
pursuing a new field of development so
if your Society had basically been
occupying its Elites through like a
religious system for example opening up
a commercial way for Elites to pursue
games right so people who are very
ambitious who are very skilled if they
come into an environment that is a
positive some like learning environment
even for them if most of someone's
career is positive somew will they will
develop positive some skills if most of
someone's career is negative some
they're going to develop negative Su
skills who do you wish to be surrounded
by so if maybe say an extracted someone
decaded over overdeveloped religion such
as some people would say the Catholic
church was in the late medieval period
encounters you know a a vibrant
meritocratic um bureaucratic uh sort of
state where it's a young bureaucracy not
yet dysfunctional like say maybe the
French state was or the British one uh
Power very naturally shifts to the other
one and civilization as a whole changes
but it becomes positive some game again
and then maybe later on say religion as
it persists in the 18th or 19th century
becomes positive sum again because they
are no longer the predominant Trends
Setters of society and they have been
sort of emptied over time and starved
the negative sum game is almost
cauterized into this field that is ever
more marginalized and at one point it's
flimsy and the negative sum sort of
games are easily overturned by new
positive some
games My Hope had been for almost the
last 10 years the tech would prove to be
the positive sum game of our
civilization which forged an elite
trained on positive sum games that would
then go and I don't know Revitalize
Legacy industry you know the
manufacturer of atoms or maybe
Revitalize government or maybe
Revitalize culture and media and while
we see a few excellent examples of this
we're not seeing anywhere near enough to
overcome the extremely negative Trends
in any of the branches of government in
any of the major professions and
industries outside of tech do you think
that is because the game that is
developing the tech itself is too
already Maloy in a negative sum or or
like at least I I think it was very
positive sum in a lot of ways but again
it's it's still beholden to a lot of
these these misaligned incentives right
they're still optimizing for well we've
got to be profitable we've got to raise
our next funding round who's raised the
biggest funding round there's a lot of
sort of Dick swinging and so on is is
that the reason why Tech is being in is
insufficient to write this or is it just
because the it's it's like slapping a
Band-Aid on a rotten or like a festering
wound that is much deeper like at a
systemic level I I think that to a great
extent uh Tech is very inward looking it
does not look at the rest of society
very much I think if it looked at the
rest of society
uh they would just choose to do many
things very differently many things that
are easily preventable right easily can
be improved
upon
well let's just go for for a little bit
and acknowledge that back in 2009 or
2010 the search engine was a wonderful
Innovation that let you uh think about
the world in a completely new way um and
honestly if I could choose today between
having a 2010 era search engine or a
2020s era generative text uh model I
would choose the search engine hard bit
Yeah I think currently search engines
are terrible but they've become much
much worse than they were 10 years ago
the median quality of the information
and Source I could find in 2010 was very
high if I wanted to find you know a uh a
highgrade uh crackpot artist who was
completely correct about some small
Niche thing in 2010 that was easy
I believe those still exist but if I try
to find one today online I don't find
them and how much prompting would I have
to give to a model to have it say I
don't know replace GW right GW BR
g.net it's impossible I cannot prompt
the llm to give me
GW I could find GW in 2010 Google right
if you're a new person you're not
finding them now you are not finding G
in 2024 with your search engine so okay
there was a massive positive information
revolution in the '90s and 2000s that
actually counteracted and corrected for
somewhat the decline of Academia without
the internet it's not clear to me at all
that the replication crisis would have
even happened I don't I'm not even sure
we would have figured that out it
wouldn't have been a crisis in the first
place or we would not have we would not
have diagnosed it we wouldn't have
diagnosed it we have just believe the
 studies and we've believed it
for decades to come right which is a
thing you know nature allows that to
happen there's nothing just universe
that pretend us from being prevents us
from being deluded for a century or more
right
um but you you challenged me to say what
could Tech do better so I'm going to
give as concrete an answer as I can what
tech could do better today after having
acknowledged immense positive
contributions like Wikipedia again it's
not only uh a tldr of everything our
society has achieved it was actually
very productive in the enlightenment
sense because people would use Wikipedia
reason about it and the community of
Wikipedia editors which of course they
had their own political biases but they
maintained rigor and Excellence for
basically social incentive reasons so in
a way Wikipedia was closer to Old peer
review than bureaucratic new peer review
is right so I think Wikipedia is a great
example of Technology entering our
society and picking up a function that
you know 200 years ago would have
literally been down to uh the editors of
encyclopedias who at the time thought
that they were transforming Society by
giving everyone access to knowledge and
in a way probably they were um still
acknowledging all these you know I could
we could talk about 10 other positive
contributions but acknowledging those
what can they do
today you know I think the most the best
things for Tech to do unfortunately are
not the most profitable I think no
matter what you do the margins for
software are always better than
Hardware we have saturated much of what
can be be done with
software we should be pursuing many more
Hardware
improvements at the very least I would
wish to see top Tech Talent allocated
with significant funding to optimizing
the factory floor the way we have tried
to optimize the news feed can you
imagine a big data approach to
manufacturing that's real automation
that's that's that would be remarkable
right um
I believe further
that a lot of tech wealth could be
deployed in a very classic way that is
not understood very well which is
socially responsible
philanthropy I think we live in an era
where there's no for-profit reason to
give accurate
information I think what should be done
and ideally the billionaire should be
diverse in their thinking I think if
every billionaire basically funded a
private blog with their favorite
thinkers and they took pride that these
are different and distinct from what all
of their friends are funding I think
those could be very positive uh
nonprofit organizations keep them small
keep them diverse have them be these
sort of like you know focused on
Excellence have them critique each other
basically for social status points
because the monetization just seems too
tricky I think that could work extremely
well especially if one cauterized the
sort of of like New York media scene you
know by hiring former and current New
York Times
journalists that's how you go from being
early wired to being late wired you mean
the magazine the magazine yeah yeah for
say I don't know Mike sana's pirate
wires is as soon as they start hiring
professional journalists it's over
knowing Mike I don't think they're going
to do that he's he's got I mean but at
the same time the the incentives are
there right you want you want the big
names so yeah and we could we could go
further and I think that I'm glad that
say Gary tan is undertaking some amount
of uh let's call it uh you know Yim
activism in the Bay Area probably you
know if you're uh leading YC you
correctly identify that uh Bay Area
rents and lack of construction are
actually eating up a lot of the money
one invests into software companies uh
but I I really do think that uh a new
look at Urban politics in the United
States would do much to fix the problems
of society and is somewhere where I
think technocratic Solutions just would
work so again the talent the IQ of the
industry is there and tools could be
leveraged right information like what
though what what would be the
technocratic solution to these these
policy
bottlenecks literally spend any effort
at all to try to change the policies so
in other words I'm saying I wish Tech
Elites were as politically active in our
society as journalists would like to
pretend that they are I see I see given
they're getting called that anyway they
might as well do it they might as well
do it there's no negative to the
reputation in fact maybe they are
actively punished because they're not
doing it who do you critique you
critique the person where there's no
consequence to critiquing them at all
right and with regard to you know with
regard to the you know leveraging of a
of a the unique expertise right I think
the space of organizing voters even the
voters themselves being organized right
so not even top down organization just
giving voters tools for them to organize
themselves massive disruption
opportunities people have totally
stopped talking about digital democracy
and stuff like that that was very
popular in the early 2000s right it's
just it's
gone well mostly because you can't
really easily make money off of it but
the positive returns to fixing a
country's politics would be M right even
eventually financially like if you live
in a well functioning country so many
things are much easier business-wise you
wrote this book on great founder Theory
um which I'll try and paraphrase is
essentially that some of the greatest
civilizations or institutions in history
were off the back of either a singular
or a small number of in incredibly
talented forward thinking individuals
and that was an integral part of sort of
our March Humanity's March of progress
what role do you think that that could
play in trying to write the ship of
current Western Civilization well um you
know to uh to restate great founder
Theory as I formulated it it is uh you
know a variant on the so-called great
man approach that historians in the 20th
century critiqued in favor of Trends
forces and so on and uh the key the Crux
of it is that I believe Innovations in
Social technology that is human
coordination and that is you know human
organization are usually the work of an
individual or very small groups when
they're first prototyped and introduced
to society but once introduced to
society have a footprint that can last
thousands of years and very simple
examples would be you know even you know
we talked about Confucian civilization
Christianity all of these things well
organized religions usually have a
founder right uh sometimes it's not the
founder it's credited to uh we could
debate about the true origin and
development of say something like the
Catholic church or something like the
sort of confusion strategy of we're
going to study the classics and then
we're going to travel around the Waring
States period China trying to convince
uh you know the princes of these states
that they need you know very
high-skilled civil administrators and
they we're going to run that that little
statelet well and eventually that
statelet is going to be all of China so
uh and by the way that is literally sort
of confucius's life and the life of his
students uh they were just these
wandering Scholars trying to explain why
they would do a good job of running
these things and shockingly it worked
right you wouldn't think that you can
have uh you know sword wielding rulers
be talked out of running things but it's
only when you remember how tedious it is
actually to run things where you realize
how easily that can work would the
founding fathers of the US be an example
of great Founders uh yes very much so I
think that um
it is hard to deny that they're
definitely one of the you know peaks of
sort of Enlightenment era civilization
their aspirations were not limited right
if you see you know Jefferson Thomas
Jefferson like editing the Bible to be
more rational or Benjamin Franklin being
very interested in uh you know science
natural science that was not unique that
was actually common in their mil and
they've definitely debated for real and
wrote pamphlets not just to persuade the
public but to persuade each other and
they had vigorous disagreements about
they actually wrote essays they actually
wrote essays they were discovering and
they gathered together and you know if
if I told you that you know we're going
to gather 300 of the smartest and most
powerful Americans today and they're
going to decide what the next government
will look like that sounds a little bit
scary a little bit exciting a little bit
impossible but that is literally the
Constitutional Convention as it happened
which was technically illegal according
to the previous laws but once you
gathered a few 200 of the most prominent
Americans who could really say no right
it was impossible to say no right and uh
there's this very fundamental way where
the system has sort of run very well
it's clear that the United States is you
know arguably like the greatest the
greatest uh political system so far in
human history just in terms of its
wealth power and influence I'm not going
to go into you know its many moral
virtues and many moral failings uh but
it's surely you know one of the most
powerful countries to have ever existed
um and you know that is definitely the
sort of uh the sort of thing that will
put Americans in the history books next
to the Romans the Chinese and so on but
to go back to sort of the great founder
Theory perspective like the founding of
religions the founding of states the
founding of new types of economic
organizations right um the founding of
uh new cities you look at the history of
it often and it's like very very
concentrated and they come into
existence very rapidly you sometimes
have long periods of stasis followed by
a very short period of development
followed by a much slower rate of change
presumably and by short you mean short
exactly short enough for a single
lifetime which would suggest that it was
basically one person or a small number
of a small number of people working
together to sort of design new rules for
a game new rules of the game exactly
which is precisely what we saw with the
American Revolution
it's precisely what we saw with like you
know the big religious transformations
of history and big military or economic
transformations of History so uh having
having said all of this I think that in
the past whenever you have a society
trapped in negative sum games it is
precisely on the creation of new social
Technologies where the Hope rests for
positive sum games so I think today we
are hope generating enough people who
have the potential to be great Founders
that there will be a transformation in
some sectors of our society that goes us
from a losing streak where we're sort of
living off our inheritance where maybe
you know the numbers are still going up
and maybe even the first derivative is
positive but the second derivative has
gotten very negative so we need to break
out of that spiral uh and I think that
can only happen through such
individuals to push back on great
Theory I wonder
whether because presumably with history
there's going to be these sort of blind
spots and biases in the way that the
information has been recorded like we
love to think of things through stories
right and how what what usually happens
in a story that there's a a singular
protagonist and we can go okay well they
did that and they wanted this and
therefore this happened stories aren't
very good at telling and nor is wris
history telling the story
like telling of situations where it's
kind of a decentralized bottomup type
thing that emerges so I I I worry
whether it's like taking a kind of
overly deterministic sort of view of of
history or at least downplaying the
effects of emergent things that have
happened what would you say to that I
would say that definitely there are many
very important emergent phenomena that
have happened through the course of
history in fact it's very useful to
study those and very useful to try to
model those great Trends um having
having said that though I think
that precisely because of our limits of
modeling a very complex reality we have
to focus on the most explanatory bits
right and I think that while great
founder theory is not supposed to be a
total theory of all social phenomena it
does a rather good job of tracking the
following rise and fall of organized
religions rise and fall of political
systems uh the great uh technological or
economic transformations of several eras
and you know if you got those three I
think you're doing pretty well right and
I think
that so much so much
of what we would consider bottomup
change right so much of it rests on
changes in the macro environment right
it's sort of like you know in a desert
when the climate pattern shifts and the
rain starts to fall more frequently of
course the seedlings growing everywhere
sprouting and eventually the trees
growing of course that's a decentralized
phenomena but it might be just a side
effect of a single weather pattern
changing and there being an extra monume
there right so if you consider something
like the introduction of a new code of
law of course of course the the work
people working under incentives of the
code of law are that's decentralized
right people suddenly have an incentive
to open or create a small business they
create a small business that wasn't
centrally planned however the
transformation from say I don't know a
Soviet styled planned economy to an open
competitive economy that had to be a
centralized change people might argue
that oh but the Soviet Union you know we
can focus on that concrete example
Soviet Union fell for this or that
inevitable reason
as far as we can tell it was sort of
just this coua of Boris yelon versus
gorbachov where the constituent
republics the heads of those republics
who are already very powerful people in
the Soviet Union sort of got together
and they're like do we even need
gorbachov do we even need the central
system let's split this thing apart and
when they did this meant Liberation for
many of the Baltic states this meant uh
a chance at independent development for
Ukraine but for many places like you
know the initial very power ful person
that made that decision just stayed in
charge as dictator as happened in a lot
of Central Asian republics so history
offers many many natural experiments
where we get to see because consider if
it's truly the collapse of the Soviet
Union was truly such a bottom-up
phenomena of like Freedom versus
dictatorship surely those Central Asian
dictatorships should have been basically
impossible like the same bottom up that
overthrew the Soviet Union should have
overthrown them right in term and maybe
one could argue oh that was the delayed
reaction it was you know it had to wait
until the the so-called colored
Revolutions in the 2000s but by that
point we're dealing with the effects of
the internet Society has changed so much
look that's 20 years after the fall of
the Soviet Union I think it's a very
tenuous argument that that's what
happened right so what do you suspect
the common traits are that is shared by
great Founders and
what what type of personality traits
would be necessary for great Founders or
game design whatever you whatever you
want to call them that would be
necessary to help Society out of its
current Funk
today well those are two huge questions
and um you know you you you you've asked
many huge questions today which I
struggle to answer do very well strive
to answer yeah yeah um but to focus on
maybe the first one I think that nearly
everyone has to thread the very delicate
needle of being capable of disagreeing
with nearly everyone in our in your
societ Society without needing to
disagree with everyone as it not having
the personal need of egoic attachment to
it or what anyone who is always attached
to disproving what everyone else is
saying will never be able to work with
other people well enough to transform
even a single organization let alone uh
an industry or a or or a society or a
civilization you you have to be um so
the people are sometimes somewhat
megalomaniacal but they can't be too
detached from reality because with
Detachment from reality comes a lack of
ability to survey the landscape right uh
there has to be this like you know this
sort of threaded needle where they
either for diluted reasons or good
reasons believe they personally have the
moral authority to transform Society
they might believe that they're chosen
by God or that all that matters is
technological progress and I'm making
technological progress happen or that
you know I'm producing a wealthier
society and my opponents are sort of
like you know the randan villains of the
story something has to be there that
morally justifies first to yourself and
then to your close allies action because
human defaults tend toward inaction and
I think we are extremely good as a
species of bullying each other out of
doing things I think this is an
underemphasized fact of human nature
that we are very much uh you know we are
very much a species that does not like
the tall poppy we try to cut it down
we're sort of fascinated in an almost
salacious way when someone gets away
with being exceptional we kind of
worship them we over focus on them and
when they slip up just a little we're
vicious we're ready to pounce so our
excitement is more kind of this uh it's
very unflattering I think I think we can
be quite abusive to the exceptional
people in our societies and always have
been as a species uh because the rewards
are very high possibly of successfully
being such a person but the the
punishment is always there the most
dangerous profession you could have in
the Roman Empire was being Emperor your
odds of a violent death were very very
high and I think in the modern United
States the most dangerous profession you
can have is actually still technically
the president your odds of being
assassinated are what 3% that's pretty
dangerous I there are few jobs there are
few jobs where I have a 3% chance of
being murdered maybe like a military vet
when the US is actually in a serious War
maybe that comes close but I don't even
think that comes close so that tells you
something interesting right even though
we're much less violent than Rome ever
was or Sumerian society ever was we're
very peaceful Society uh it tells you
that there is an exposure for violence
which leads me to feature number two I
think there's
something about sheer tolerance for
stress sheer physiological tolerance for
cortisol that has to be much higher in
that type of
person and then the third feature is the
ability to have sustained long-term
allies and again this is a place where a
good story often is just true if you
examine independent or hostile accounts
for discussing the life of say I don't
know Muhammad or of Julius Caesar even
their enemies acknowledge that they have
close allies who follow them for most of
their lives who they can rely on who
they can confide secrets in who they
could even voice doubts to because no
individual you know no matter again how
effectively megalomaniacal or how high
their stress resilience is can process
all the information truly all they can
do is be sort of a clearing house for
the cross information of a of a trusted
small group and even the most uh
caricatured historical figures like
let's look at Napoleon right um he
relied greatly on his military
commanders and on his legal experts and
I wouldn't say that he was necessarily a
great founder unless a French
civilization endures for another 500
years because the code of law uh that he
ProMag Napoleon's code of law is
actually the basis of civil law all over
Continental Europe so if that system
proves to be
successful we we could retroactively say
that Napoleon was a defeated military
commander but despite that still a great
founder if he successfully introduced
the code of law his key ability was
despite his Cult of Personality to still
have
close allies and people that he could
work with for years or decades I mean
it's it's clear that some people do have
more of those traits I know some of them
personally as you going through that
list I'm like yep that fits the bill on
a number of like like powerful CEOs or
whoever people who are um they're just
incredibly resilient and they aren't
afraid of like challenging opinions and
so on
but it does seem to be the case
that certainly Fame and
to a large degree the power that comes
with it or just power even without Fame
will eventually fry your brain I have
not yet seen anyone whose brain has not
been at least partially Fried by that so
how to manage that if if we are if we
want to find people who are able to
think through these hold these
incredibly complex issues in their head
sufficiently and design structures and
have enough of a cult of personality to
bring people who will help them bring
these things to life how to stop them
from then getting um drunk on their own
success well there are certainly ways to
ameliorate that problem but let me
perhaps propose that in the big picture
this is less of a problem than we often
fear if through the course of
revolutionizing an industry of say
through the course of Steve Jobs giving
Society the iPhone right or through the
course of Buddha launching uh you know a
self-help movement that in the west
we'll call a religion let's let's say uh
or you know Charlemagne uh breaking the
constant tribal conflicts and producing
the system we think of as
feudalism they go a little bit insane I
mean that sure isn't nice for them it
probably isn't nice for people towards
the end of their career but from the
perspective of civilization as a whole
they've already delivered their
payload you know I you know in biology
we're often like well after you
reproduce it sure is unpleasant where
your body falls apart but it's what
natural selection has selected for and
unfortunately maybe like you know it is
the cost of this process of social
creation of the creation of a new social
technology that has to be you can't just
write about your Utopia you have to
build a prototype community that
actually carries out these ideas and
look your prototype Community could be I
don't know pl's Academy sorry it could
be Aristotle's Academy right it could be
Plato's school it could be a new city
state it could be a new religion once
you've built it it is bigger than you it
outlasts you and even if you do other
things that are bad for society or bad
for you or those close to you I think
Society has been vastly improved by Your
Presence by your existence by that
initial Act of Creation I could be a
little bit provocative and you know
point out that you know uh you know a
scientific analogy here would be maybe
Fritz hubber uh who you know very
important for the hubber Bosch process C
how it's How we create all our
artificial fertilizers this guy in the
early 1900s I think probably responsible
for at least like half of the yields of
the so-called Green Revolution which
allowed us to feed billions of people so
really saved many many millions of lives
on the other hand though also you know
worked for the government in World War I
and made poison gas and I'm sure that
killed a few thousand or tens of
thousands of people and then on net it
sure would be nice if we could have have
a clean utilitarian hero that just did
the farming revolution and didn't do the
poison gas but really he was the kind of
person that was up for either and was
convinced that this was sort of both
good right he he believed in my side
should win the war not the other
chemistry will revolutionize all aspects
of life and really that sort of positive
and negative thing um I think often goes
together so my argument would be the
following I think that as a societ soety
we need stem cells in the body of
society we need the stem cells that go
around the body and become new skin new
hair new um new nerve cells right highly
adaptable right and if we downregulate
the amount of such stem cells we will
age and we will die as a society if we
upregulate it yes also the risk of
cancer goes up but on that I think we
really need renewal that badly so I I
really do think that the the sort of
power issue I think so much more evil in
the world has happened through something
not being done than through something
being done it's very lopsided even even
if we put genghiskhan and all the you
know terrible conquerors of history on
the pile and we put them next to all the
city builders who are also often
conquerors to be honest we just talked
about Alexander raised many cities built
many cities on that
probably good for Humanity probably the
library of alexand comp but it's a
complicated equation but if we put those
people on a pile and then we add
cultural reform and scientific reform
and weird groups pursuing various
aspects of knowledge I think it clearly
comes on the side of onet human agency
is good and in the bottom line when we
talk about power we're talking about
human agency right maybe it is the case
that humans can only endure so much
agency and with too much agency too much
optionality our brain goes Ary but I
think fundamentally we are better off
with a higher agency set point than a
lower one we are nowhere near the
frontier of crazy irresponsible people
running around we are very close to
saturated on extremely boring very
parasitical very inactive extractive
Elites right so we're close to
saturation on the senescent cells we are
nowhere near on saturation
on like new crazy people running around
you could argue though that we are now
in a world where through technology and
particularly information technology
that such power is becoming increasingly
democratized so well I'm curious because
like I just had Nick bostom on he you
know his thesis on the vulnerable World
hypothesis talks about um for the most
part most Technologies are great and
that's good that we are democratizing
them uh but sometimes you pull out a bad
technology that is actually incredibly
damaging and if you democratize that
make it available to everyone then the
individual the the ability for the
individual to everything up is has
increased
so wouldn't
that you're saying that actually the
rate of democratization of power is
insufficient compared to the stasis well
the way I would propose it is that um
individuals or small groups wielding
power pursuing a gentic agendas happens
much less than we think it does right
most Elites extremely passive extremely
homeostasis seeking right only
protecting you know I I Ed the phrase
class interest or class privilege
previously they've got power and they
just want to keep it exactly and and
they want to give it to people like them
right and it's it's not explicitly
thought of it's just like oh I get along
so well with this person and you know we
met in college and which college was
that and we were in the same frat and it
was the Frat was the
right it's very not self-aware and
people sometimes hallucinate and imagine
that they're agentic Elites elsewhere
and then you're like but wait I've just
talked to all the top academics of this
country I've just talked to several
people who are you know members members
of parliament and I've talked to the
most prominent businessmen and in in a
small country like maybe Slovenia or
maybe a little bit bigger like Britain
where are these agentic movers and
shakers like everyone assumes that
someone else is out there improving
Society but really if you're in an elite
position and your Social Circle is in an
elite position and you see most of them
are not doing much that means no one in
your Society is doing much okay with
that with that point sort of out of the
way um you know to address what I think
is sort of there in your question with
regard to
democratization I am skeptical of the
democratization of our society for a
variety of reasons I think our society
is very oligarchic and power has
actually concentrated in these sort of
like aifi stagnant non- agentic centers
where the main mode of exercising power
today say in the European Union or in
the United States and honestly any large
country is the veto in the European
Union the most powerful person is a
french-speaking bureaucrat in Brussels
that you've never heard of who says no
says no to something being done and and
in the United States there are so many
reasons not to do things right at the
federal level at the sort of political
level and we are saturated in these
various
Elites they are not very agentic they
are powerful but because they don't do
anything they just forbid things you can
never call gotcha on the power we don't
recognize forbidding something as an
abuse of power we recognize doing
something as an abuse of power in case
it goes wrong yeah and that's kind of
messed up definitely it's an it's an
asymmetry of information essentially
very fundamentally and then we were just
talking about the failure of the
epistemic commons I think there is no
way that power is De more democratized
now than it was 20 years ago because you
know my phone is not my ally in making
sense of the world it is actively trying
to run basically scops on me at all
times and all places and you know by
carrying around this phone or an Apple
phone if people prefer those you are
basically giving away your location at
all times times you are basically
recording every conversation you have
and while you might trust the very inert
and uncreative
Elites that run the big software
companies or that run the government
agencies that can legally demand any
data your uh big software organizations
have your companies your nonprofit
foundations
whatever uh while you might trust their
inactivity the fact is you as an
individual are vastly more transparent
to any bureaucracy today than you were
at any previous point in human history
in no previous point in human history
could a bureaucracy gather as much
information on you as an individual as
they can today and I claim that you as
an individual have less of an ability to
gather information on the inner working
of a bureaucracy today than even 10
years ago I think even compliance with
things like the Freedom of Information
Act Right have been much attenuated and
the idea that it is irresponsible for
large bureaucracies to not keep accurate
records that's sort of gone away and the
software and information tools that an
individual could use to study those
organizations they're not been developed
we've only developed ways to monetize
and examine the individual we've not
developed the software tools to look at
large bureaucracies Argo over time large
bureaucracies are more powerful than
individuals and large bureaucracies
unless piloted by live player so like an
act
agentic individual will come to be run
by homeostasis seeking self-serving rent
extracting oligarchies so it sounds
really like what you're arguing for is
we just need actually a higher
complexity State we need greater risk
tolerance I would say we need greater
risk tolerance for reform of major
government institutions and we need
greater risk tolerance in terms of
Industry disruption and we need greater
intellectual risk tolerance where we
encourage people uh to and we try to
sustain them socioeconomically in
developing new ideas of how nature works
and how Society Works what advice would
you give to anyone watching
who feels like they resonate with this
idea of a great founder and want to try
and be one themselves I mean first off
it's very excellent to try to be one
yourself I just selfishly encourage you
because we all benefit from the
externalities on net uh but secondly I
also propose perhaps find ing a great
founder and trying to be part of their
team and trying to be a functional
member of a small group might be a more
practical First
Step where I think in our society we've
lost a lot of this idea of recognizing
and valuing greatness in others this
perhaps a way in which I might be
slightly less individualist like a lot
of My Philosophy can be described as is
very hyper individualist maybe almost
nich and Will To Power but one of the
things I also believe is in valuing
appreciating and supporting Human
Excellence I think there's an unders
supply of people seeking out the most
agentic people in society and attempting
to enhance them and strengthen them and
help them correct their flaws and and
ass system maybe with going a little bit
less crazy
or being a trusted team member and
long-term associate a part of lost
Western social technology is I think
actually the loss of a loadbearing uh
type of friendship that once existed
right whether it be the sort of like
scientific collegiality where you both
care about the truth and you're actually
collaboratively working towards it uh
whether it's the kind of uh you know
board when the first you know when the
East India Company met to do you know
their business or whatever uh a very
trivial thing is that they would open
the meetings with prayer because the
pretense was that actually what we're
trying to do here is work each other
and we're just trying to do good work
together and only incidentally are we
like super rich and making a lot of
money and being super powerful and I
think the uh idea of valuing other
individuals so much that you want to
help them fully develop their potential
that is something that was there in the
DNA of Western Civilization it was there
even in classical civilization if you
read Plato and Aristotle on friendship
right they elevate it to this level that
we just don't understand it's it's it's
elevated even above romantic love in the
writing right I think that allowed very
functional small groups to work together
so I would propose find someone in your
life who you think has great potential
and do your best to Mentor them or
assist them or learn from them or teach
them to try to correct their flaws and
like be constructive right don't don't
say no say yes to things of others and I
think the the adage of of uh you know
there's no limit to the good you can do
if you don't care who gets the credit
will prove very true all right so to
finish up um I would love to ask you
some rapid fire questions around uh
geopolitical
predictions um because you are an
analyst ultimately well one of your main
things you do is you are you run Bismark
analysis which is essentially an
intelligence gathering resource
basically private intelligence and a
research and consulting firm we also put
out the weekly bismar brief which is you
know well received and has a a very
interesting set of subscribers I
certainly practice what I preach right I
try to give accurate evaluations of the
world so fire away
okay percentage likelihood that Tik Tok
gets removed from the App Store in the
US by the end of
2025 I think that the US uh regulatory
apparatus moves slowly and the counter
measures are fairly effective Ive so I
would say that about
20% likelihood that Ukraine joins NATO
by end of 2030 okay I would put that at
about
35% likelihood that Co was a lab
leak 75% 80% 80%
yeah likelihood Netanyahu stands down by
end of
2024 I don't have an excellent model of
is Israeli domestic politics I think the
uh a lot of the details there are opaque
uh mostly because of the very competent
Security Services of the
country I would bet that it's likelier
than not that Netanyahu endures just
because he is such a effective
politician but with low
confidence likelihood that China invades
Taiwan by end of
20126 fairly low I would put it under
10%
finally likelihood that Epstein killed
himself
15% okay it's pretty low uh awesome uh
any other any other big predictions
you'd like to make that you are very
high confidence on okay well that's
that's an interesting challenge in its
own right uh I predict in 3 years or
actually no I predict in 5 years most of
us will still have a job and AI will not
have five us maybe it'll make our job
much more boring kind of lame and
rote uh but you know I have a quip that
says uh you know you know it's
impossible to out automate fake jobs I
think our society has a high degree of
jobs that only exist because of sort of
regulatory and social needs and that
actually we have secretly already
implemented Ubi it's called having a
middle class job and it's just sort of
janky through all of these like hyper
regulated types of ways and which we
redistribute wealth unofficially so you
think that actually a lot of people
going to an office is purely
performative and I think it's doesn't
mean that they're having a good time I'm
just saying that our society has a
political need for jobs that exceeds its
economic need and while AI advancements
might well come to the point where they
suppress the economic need or meet the
economic need they do nothing for the
political need for jobs uh I do think
it's for example telling them when it
comes to large tech companies it's
extremely un clear what the median
software engineer does I think you could
easily go through every single major
tech company and fire half of the
software engineers and you'd be okay and
the user wouldn't notice a big
difference I mean Elon did it with
Twitter right he did % yeah yeah yeah
yeah uh but you know he had to know what
he was doing for that but I almost think
that if you didn't know what you were
doing and just magic eight balled it and
fired half of them the other half would
scramble to do that job pretty well and
if that's true in Tech which is actually
a very demanding field very rigorous
technically like technically demanding
what does that say about so many other
sectors of our society I think we are
inundated with um make workor that
secretly is a type of work it's just
political work we don't think of it as
political work but it kind of is right
like what what's the point of having a
large team of Engineers if it makes the
product worse well it means that the
manager of the engineering team claims
greater Authority can claim like more
credit might Advance inside the
hierarchy what's the point of a big tech
company having 10,000 employees rather
than a thousand employees it's sort of
like you know Mr Congressman we bring
10,000 high paying jobs to California we
can signaling thing again exactly and
why why do the elected officials care
about whether they are 10,000 highp
paying jobs in Austin well that answers
itself doesn't it so it sounds like
actually perhaps the most promising
disrup disruption could come through
lifting the veil on the signaling game
an effective accounting of the economy
and politics would be a revolutionary
act and uh I think there's more effort
that can be put to that thank you so
much thank
you so there we go everyone thank you so
much for tuning in and huge thanks to
Sam for this conversation in the show
notes below are links to a lot of his
writing I really recommend taking a
peruse uh also if you want to keep your
finger on the geopolitical pulse do
check out his weekly Bismark brief you
can also give him a follow on Twitter
lastly quick request please if you
enjoyed this give this podcast a good
review on whatever platform you're
listening on I hate to ask but it really
helps so anyway thank you and I will
catch you next week
