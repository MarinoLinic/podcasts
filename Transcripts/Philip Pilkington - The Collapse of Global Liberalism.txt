Hello, my name is Jacob Williams. I'm
the head of domestic policy at Pickul
House and I'm here with Fez Ahmed, our
head of foreign policy. Pickful House is
a UK- based think tank that specializes
in finding pragmatic, workable policy
solutions to the challenges of rising
diversity and pluralism at home and our
increasingly multipolar global order.
We're delighted to be joined today with
the economist and author Philip
Pilkington. An experienced
macroeconomist and investment
professional. His 2016, The Reformation
in Economics, argued that mainstream
neocclassical economics often exhibits a
faith in market equilibria that's driven
more by ideology than by scientific
rigor. And since then, Dr. Pilington has
written for a range of publications
including Unheard, the Guardian, The
Critic, as well as hosting the popular
multi-polarity podcast, which documents
the rise of a global order less
dominated by the West rather than
divided between multiple competing
centers of power. and his new book, The
Collapse of Global Liberalism, which is
released in the UK on the 30th of May,
2025 with Policy Press, explores the
collapse of Western Liberal Hijgemony in
global geopolitics, and the rise and
resilience of non-liberal powers,
including China and Russia, as well as
the failures of what he calls
hyperliberalism in domestic policy. Our
focus today is going to be principally
on the geopolitical issues raised by the
book. So uh to begin with, if you could
Philillip for our viewers uh summarize
the the main geopolitical thesis of the
book and how you see global politics
developing over the next few years as we
go deeper into this multipolar world.
Yeah. Well, um so the book's a little
bit broader than just the multipolarity
topic, I think. Um it became clear to me
shortly after the uh Russian invasion of
Ukraine that something big was changing
in the world. not so much that something
big was changing, just that uh trends
that had been set in motion probably 30
years beforehand or something like that
were being massively accelerated. Um and
we started the podcast on the back of
that and I kind of made it my main focus
of um of writing. I'm currently working
in foreign affairs now um and all that
kind of thing. So I became very focused
on that on that issue. Um I think I
think some of us some people were saying
we were talking rubbish at the time.
This was back 22 23. I think we've been
pretty much vindicated. Um I think we
can do a victory lap on that one. Um but
the book is about something a little bit
broader because um prior to being
interested in the accelerated
developments and multipolarity if you
want to put it that way sounds a little
bit economic uh academic jargonistic but
uh what can we do? Um but I you know in
addition to that there was clearly a big
movement taking place in the United
States which I know you're interested in
and in Britain too about um about a move
away from liberalism or a move beyond
liberalism. Um some often called
post-liberalism and that sort of thing.
And you know I was involved in that um
probably going back to the first Trump
election. Um I wrote a lot with the
journal American affairs. I was I was
quite close to a lot of people in that
world um that were trying to develop
those ideas. Um and of course I I
sympathized with them massively. Um and
it seems to me I guess the book the
thesis of the book is that the emerging
multipolar world order is actually the
beginning of the collapse of of global
liberalism itself and really the
collapse of liberalism. And that's a
massive claim. I mean, that's a bigger
claim really than Fukiyama was making in
the 90s. Um because he was saying, you
know, okay, everything's everything's
now static and we're going to live in
this permanently liberal world. And
that's a pretty big claim. Wrong, I
think. But um but brave. Um but this is,
I think, a a more controversial claim
because the the liberal project is is
half a millennial. Not half a century,
it's half a millennia old. I basically
date it to John Lock's two treaties on
government. If you want the first
political development, it's probably the
English Civil War, but you know, we
don't have to have the historical
debates. It's about 500 years old, this
development. And it seems to me that
it's buckling under pressure now. Um
those pressures are coming from a few
places. Obviously, the the multipolar
developments are absolutely key. Um
because, as you said in the
introduction, uh non-liberal or
illiberal powers, not post-liberal
mainly, although I'd say Russia is
post-liberal because they went through a
very liberal phase. Um you could maybe
argue Iran is post-liberal too given the
fact that they went through a liberal
phase in the in the 20th century but um
and maybe Turkey but um mostly for the
most part illiberal I don't think India
was ever liberal I don't think China was
ever liberal for example um so this is
this is putting pressure from the global
direction on the western liberal
countries but internally the the
liberalism itself seems to be collapsing
um what you referred to there as hyper
liberalism I I I say in the book this
kind of kicked in in the in the mid in
the early 1990s basically when Fukuyama
said the end of history and um these
liberal trends that were were nent in
the society they were there for a very
long time about 500 years but they'd
been contained by non-liberal forces in
society and by that I really mean um
structures that were handed over
basically from the Christian tradition
in the west family structures
um communal structures There's taboss on
certain things, not just sexual taboos,
taboos on certain types of economic
activity, everything. All these things
that held society in check that were
there at every point of liberal
development. 1776 in America, they were
there all throughout the 19th century in
Britain and so on. And they kind of kept
the liberal check, the forces in check.
that all came undone in the really I'd
say in the 2010s but you know the seeds
were definitely laid um at the beginning
of the 1990s and um I think at that
point it became increasingly clear that
liberalism was not a viable system for
running a society um and that's
effectively where the post-lberal
critiques started to come in I'd say
again 2010s probably although you know
you can go back to McIntyre and so on
and you can say that these these things
were there for quite a long time. They
were also there for a long time, the
Marxian tradition, which is a wholly
different uh uh thing, which I think is
an interesting subplot in the history.
But basically, that's the that's the
basic overarching idea. Liberalism is
collapsing at home and the global uh
liberal order that we tried to really
establish Wick Gustoau post the post the
Cold War. Um but you know, it set in
place in probably 1946 as well. Um is
now kind of collapsing really. I mean,
it's falling apart. So, liberalism is
crumbling at at at multiple levels. And
it's funny, I will say it's funny how
these things work. If you're if you're
religious or something like that, then
like you can say, okay, well, there's a
teiology to history and there's a reason
that everything collapses at the same
time. Um, if you're not, it must be very
shocking that the two things have just
kind of imploded at once. There are
relationships between the collapse of
the global liberal order and the
collapse of domestic liberalism, but
there it's not a necessary connection.
So, it's a fascinating moment really.
Yeah, I know that's um fascinating. Um
the how would you kind of characterize
the the the Trump presidency as a sort
of um sort of harbinger of uh of of the
the collapse of liberalism? There are
kind of obvious things that um that
people would point to um that that sees
Trump as a real departure from uh from
traditional American sort of liberal
order. um let's say for example on the
economic side, tariffs, the kind of
reversal of the glut of dollars that we
have in the world and trying to turn
America into a sort of export surplus
economy. Um and then just um the the
kind of transactional nature of his
relationships with with other powers
that are not predicated on a shared
liberal ethic but more sort of real
politique.
Um well okay so we have to take a few
things here. First of all the first
Trump administration was a massive
surprise. Um historians will no doubt
try and read something into it. Maybe
there's some logic to that. But really
it was just a massive surprise. Now the
one thing that you can read into the
first Trump presidency is that there was
a lot of discontent in America.
Basically discontent that the American
empire wasn't working anymore. People
came to realize that in the Obama
administration. Obama himself, by the
way, had some sympathies in this
direction. We must not forget.
Strangely, and you know, conservatives
will kill me for this, but the Obama
administration had some post-lberal
tendencies in it of their own, at least
globally. Um, and you know, the the the
the right-wingers would say it was all
weak and mushy and all that. Well, it's
playing out pretty pretty pretty tidily
today. And I I I saw that Obama um met
Trump and there's there's uh rumors of a
tet. I'm not surprised by any of that to
be honest. But um but anyway, so the the
the Trump phenomenon you have to look at
from a couple from a couple of different
um perspectives. So the first of them is
that it definitely signaled that the
empire wasn't working. The global
liberal empire wasn't working. Centered
around America with Britain as a as a
minority partner and increasingly
minority as time went on. Um that wasn't
working. That wasn't working for America
and that's why they voted for Trump. Um,
does the average MAGA person understand
that? Actually, yeah, better than people
think, to be honest. Americans didn't
care about foreign policy until about
four years ago and they started caring
about it because they started to link
the two things. Um, because people
aren't stupid and they they at a certain
point they begin to see that something's
wrong on the global stage and it's
connected to the domestic stage. So,
that's the first thing. Second thing is
Trump's character himself. Is Trump a
post-lberal? No, I don't think so. I
think Trump's a businessman. Um, I don't
think he's particularly intellectual,
but I think he's got ideas of his own
that were not liberal. And if you go
back to um uh uh interviews with him in
the 90s or in the 1980s, by the way, he
speaks in a completely different way.
It's fascinating. That's a whole
different discussion, but he he's
clearly criticizing um hyper what I'd
call hyper liberalism, the the complete
unleashing of global free trade forces.
And he's very critical of that from a
very pragmatic uh and realist
perspective. And that's basically Trump.
That's Trump's entire stick is
everything else is movable for Trump,
but the the things that aren't movable
are the hyperliberal uh trade policies.
And also, I think he's always been
skeptical of of war and global global um
imperial ventures that don't benefit
America in some sort of a transactional
transactional manner, which arguably
none of them do because it's usually
it's not the 19th century anymore.
Engaging in these military escapades is
very very rarely economically wise. Um,
so that's Trump himself. Now, the second
Trump administration is a completely
different beast because there's been an
influx of post-lberal intellectuals into
the movement. Uh, mainly centered around
JD Vance. That does not mean that JD
Vance is a is a separate power center in
the in the in the administration. He is
not. I can tell you that for a fact. He
is not and he has no aspirations to do
that because doing that will be
political suicide. Well, first of all, I
think he's pretty loyal to Trump. Second
of all, it will be political suicide.
Trump is absolutely loved by his base.
Um, and he will be no matter what he
does. He famously said, "I could shoot
someone in Times Square and they'd still
love me." It is true. Um, so so but JD
Vance has become the kind of um he's
become the kind of uh uh rallying point
for the the post the explicitly
post-lberal forces within the
administration which are growing by the
day. There's more and more hires. I hear
a lot about the hires in certain
circles, would you believe? and there's
more and more people flowing in there um
by the day. Um but I think what we're
coming up against right now is um is
basically that I wrote my book a little
bit too late because the post-liberal
movement up until now has been a very
philosophically and even theologically
ordered uh movement. It's gone a lot
into kind of high theory um very similar
to what you'd see in actually leftwing
circles kind of marxian you know
analysis critical analysis that sort of
thing and as in marxian circles it
hasn't been great on cookshops for the
future as Mark said it hasn't been a
very good um template for governing and
what the liberals did very successfully
not initially I would say not initially
although John lock's ideas on the
structure of government are interesting
but I I think over time they developed
at least a nominally credible governance
structure about free contracts, free
trade. We could go into all the all the
parts to the to the liberal apparatus.
The post-liberals were a little late in
coming to the table with that. In fact,
I don't think they have a a coherent a
coherent uh social policy vision because
it's mainly been a philosophical
project. And so what's happening now is
they're trying to work that vision out
in real time and it's it's trial by
fire. Um, but I think the instincts are
there and I think they'll take two steps
forward, one step back, two steps
forward, one step back. And that's what
we were seeing at the tariff policies
and so on, which frankly were never
realistic. Um, but that's what's
happening. That's exactly what's
happening. And so it's learning by
doing. I'm not saying that there's no
policy work out there. American affairs
has done a fantastic job uh putting
together policy work in various uh
different disperate directions but
there's no coherent vision of of where a
post-lberal society uh should go but it
is developing and it will develop and
even if the Trump administration fails
catastrophically which it might it won't
make any difference liberalism is is
intellectually discredited and all the
energy is on the post liberal right and
if Trump is a massive failure the
post-liberals won't take it as oh well
that didn't work they'll take it as
should do better next time.
So, it's very interesting you mentioned
sort of early nent post-liberal
tendencies at least in the global sphere
even under the Obama administration
because uh one of the quite surprising
but very powerfully argued claims you
make in the book is that this
conventional assumption that the US
still has military superiority is based
on assuming that military spending is a
good proxy for actual capability. But
you argue this is this is false. Could
you explain why for our viewers? I think
it'd be fascinating to learn.
Yeah, this is um this is a disastrous uh
mis uh misinterpretation of of military.
Um it goes back to uh the creation of
macroeconomics itself. It goes back to
the first world war. Uh macroeconomics,
we won't go into the detailed history,
was born effectively out of the first
world war when Kanes uh John Mayor Kanes
and other economists saw that you could
actually manage economy on a on a macro
basis as it were. They were doing that
crudely in World War I badly. There was
a lot of inflation in World War I. It
was complete chaos. But they they
retoled the entire society around arms
production. Um much as they did in World
War II. We we tend to think today of
World War II as the great kind of uh
organiza reorganization of society along
economic uh military lines. But actually
it happened in World War I. Um World War
II was a lot more planned because
they've been thinking about it. Um and
basically the national accounts
themselves came out of this and uh
counterdepressionary strategies, demand
management and so on really were born
out of World War I, the experiences of
World War I. Remember Kane's worked in
the Treasury financing the First World
War. People forget this. He was a
treasury. He was a senior civil servant
financing the first world war. All of
those ideas came from that and many of
them did. I'd imagine if you look at
Mikuel Klei or any of these other guys,
you'll see that they were involved in
war planning um in some shape or form.
So the um modern warfare became
associated with macroeconomics in the
second world war theoretically um and
through the national accounts and uh and
that's where the conflation uh came to
be made that um that you could manage uh
a war along economic lines. Now, maybe
you can maybe maybe maybe if you're in
total war, if your economy is completely
geared toward war and your GDP accounts
are basically tracking the amount of
armaments that are being popped out the
other end, then in theory, GDP is a good
proxy for war fighting. But apart from
that, you're engaged in an absolute
fantasy. It's absolutely meaningless
because you it's not a market structure.
The the the military-industrial complex
is not a market structure. There is no
market signal to say that the F-35 is a
good plane. There is no market signal to
say that you should prioritize aircraft
over missiles. Okay? So there is
absolutely no check and balance in the
military industrial complex to make sure
that it's doing what it should be doing.
And what we've also learned very
recently is that the only check and
balance on that is testing this stuff in
real time. And actually, especially
since the collapse of the uh Soviet
Union, but I would argue all throughout
the Cold War, the military powers, but
especially the capitalist military
powers were extremely cautious about
testing the military equipment for the
simple reason that if it failed the
test, a lot of money would be lost. The
Soviet Union were less concerned about
testing the stuff because they saw it as
an opportunity to test the gear. Whereas
because we have a a for-profit system in
the West, we were very nervous about
testing the uh the the the armaments.
And we could go into a whole history
about that. How I actually think there's
there's credible evidence now that um
that the uh Scud missiles in the first
Gulf War did actually u uh overcome our
defense and it was covered up just as uh
MIT professor Ted Postol argued and he
was vigorously censored for it. He used
to work, by the way, for the Department
of Defense. he wasn't some crackpot on
the internet. Um, so I think basically,
um, we've been hoodwinkedked here a
little bit. Um, we've been told that if
you spend more on military equipment,
you get a better military. Um, but it's
not true. It's simply not true. And
actually, what the Western
military-industrial complex uh,
incentivizes is massive spending on
extremely big projects with high
margins. Okay, let me give you a real
example, real time example of this from
the UK in the past 18 months. So when
the Houthies uh uh shut down the Red
Sea, which is amazing in of itself, um
the a strike force was being put
together by the United States and as
they do, uh Britain said, "We want to be
part of this coalition of the willing."
Uh and committed or at least said they
were going to send one of their two
aircraft carriers. Within a week, it
became clear that they could not ship
the aircraft carrier out of dock because
they had an insufficient crew due to uh
due to shortages in manpower. Okay. So,
what happened there? Well, we don't know
the full details and we never will know
the full details. It's probably top
secret, classified, whatever. But
really, what's going on there is that
there's a lot of money in maintaining an
aircraft carrier, not just in building
one. Although there's a ton of money in
building one, but there's a lot of money
in maintenance and so on. Getting those
contracts is profitable. There's not a
lot of money in maintaining a crew.
That's the reality. And so the
incentives are structured in such a way
that the uh spending goes on big ticket
sexed up projects that look cool and
that you you know this fafo kind of
memes online and then it's like well do
we have a sufficient crew and it's like
well who cares about that like the
government organized that we don't have
private contracts for that we don't want
private contracts for that because it's
not worthwhile and so you can go down
the list I mean that's just an example
of the kind of Soviet tier dysfunction
that this system creates. But you can
also talk about the relative um the
relative merits of weapon systems which
we're learning a lot about at the
moment. The fact of the matter is that
um a Russian tank, a T72 or something
that's been used in Ukraine right now is
is a lot significantly cheaper than a
Challenger 2 British tank or an Abrams
tank from the United States. And let's
say that it's half the price. Okay, it's
really hard to cost uh a T72, especially
now that they've engaged in mass war
production. But let's say for the sake
of argument it's about half the price.
It's probably less than that. But let's
say it's half the price. Can an Abrams
or Challenger kill two T72s? Because if
they can't, then they can't justify the
ticket price. Well, I'll tell you they
can't because when you even when you
look at the supporters and detractors of
various tanks, who by the way have no
idea what they're talking about, it's
like listening to people talk about
football matches down at the pub to be
frank. But if you look at what they're
saying, they're always arguing within a
margin of like 10 to 20%. Oh, it's 10%
better. It's 15% better. It's all this
notion of optimization. It's like, no,
you can't justify the ticket price
unless it can kill two T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T
2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T
2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 272s. Oh, well, it
can't kill 272s. That's crazy, right?
So, that's the issue here. And you can
go down the list on this. You can say
aircraft, for example, fixed wing man
aircraft are really, really expensive.
Missiles, ballistic missiles like the
ones Iran are using are really cheap.
So, are the fixedwing aircraft that much
better? No one makes the case at least I
mean they're starting to now because
it's becoming so obvious that many much
of this technology is outdated if it
were ever in date by the way again it
was never really tried. So it's a
fascinating moment in that regard too.
Yeah, I mean I think that sort of brings
us quite nicely onto um onto what was uh
what you mentioned earlier as a sort of
watershed moment for recognition of the
sort of post-liberal world order and the
collapse of global liberalism which is
uh Russia Ukraine. Um again this seems
to be a case where we've made the same
assumption that if we just uh throw
infinite money into um into funding
Ukraine's war effort that they can
somehow overcome Russia. Um, could you
explain why why this event is so sort of
indicative of of future trends in in
weakening western power?
I mean, you could go on about the
Ukraine war. The the idea though that
equating military force with economic
power, and by the way, equating economic
power with money, what a strange thing
to do. One of the first things that
you're taught in an economics class is
forget about the money. Okay? So, if you
go into an undergrad class, they start
teaching you from a barter economy. Now
there's all debates around that. The
Keynesians hate it. The Marxians are are
bit are a bit nervous about abstracting
from the money and everything like that.
Okay, that's a whole macroeconomic
debate, whatever. But the fact of the
matter is when most people go and they
do a PPE course at Oxford or Cambridge
or whatever in the UK or they do the
equivalent at Harvard uh Kennedy
Business School whatever you know these
kind of train you and everything and
nothing uh go into government and rule
the world uh courses which I I don't
think much of frankly but they it when
they do these things look you go into
your undergrad class and they say stop
thinking in terms of money think in
terms of things the money is just a
medium of exchange.
And I don't so I don't know where these
guys they come out the other end and
then they're like oh we can just like
create money out of nowhere and it not
only magically creates economic activity
which but I'm a Keynesian by the way I I
I don't mind fiscal demand stimulus
supply has to be there guys like come
on. So but they've they've got this
magic money idea into their head not
just that they can create economic
wealth out of money creation but that
they can create military force out of
money creation. That's a completely
deranged uh uh perspective and we're
learning it every day. I saw an article
um last month. I'll give you an example.
Last month, I think it was, this was on
the Polish military spending. So, the
polls were the first to the plate,
right? They came out very early and they
said, "We're going to boost military
spending massively." So, the polls have
done in microcosmic form what the
Germans have just announced at the at
the European level. Massive money dump
which is going to create a military out
of magic. Okay? It's going to spread the
magic beans around and a military is
going to grow. The polls now are two
years deep into this and it's been a
it's been pretty much a disaster.
They've bought a load of foreign
equipment and blown out their current
account. Um, okay, that's fine. They
have the foreign equipment now. Even
that doesn't equate to a military guys.
So, the domestic they thought that they
were going to get this big
military-industrial complex off the
ground. The Poles do have, you know, a
modest military-industrial complex to
build on, but they thought just by
dumping money into the system, it would
just spray up like mushrooms after rain.
Hasn't happened. They just ended up with
a load of imports. Probably South
Korean, some American, maybe some from
Germany, two from Ry Matal or something
like that. So, that's the first um
that's the first uh mistake that was
made. But many many mistakes have been
made. I mean, Obama said when in 2014
when the Russians went into Crimea and
Obama was asked, I think in an
interview, maybe it was one of those
long form interviews, why aren't we
doing something? And he said, for
Russia, it's an existential issue.
They're willing to throw a lot of bodies
at this. And we're not. And that's just
been the reality. That's a combination
of of that. Are you willing to lose, you
know, tens of thousands of people? Are
you willing to accept thousands of
bodies coming back? No, they're not.
We're willing to accept that on the
Ukrainian side, you know, mercenary army
and all that. How's that worked out
historically, by the way? Can we go and
look at the history of alien powers
hiring mercenary armies? Okay, let's not
look into that one. Um, but there's been
so many of these things and and look,
the economic one is really deeply
rooted. It's clearly a bunch of people
who've been taught to think in terms of
PowerPoint presentations and Excel
spreadsheets, and it's become really,
really pernicious now. It's not real
economics. It's not real planning. It's
it's strange actually. It's like money.
It's like money management Uber Alice.
But beyond that, there's just a a series
of other more qualitative mistakes that
were made like the one that I just said.
That's quote from President Obama. Um,
and it's been all down the chain. And
also, I'll tell you this as well. This
is what we're coming to realize in
Europe right now. That people are only
beginning to wake up to what it means to
actually lose a war. After this war is
over, it'll become clear that a lot of
what we called war since probably since
the end of the Second World War, but
let's be generous and call Vietnam a
full-scale war. Definitely since
Vietnam. What we're losing, what we're
learning is that a great deal of what we
called war were imperial policing
operations. Very similar to what the
British undertook in the 19th century
with their marines and so on. I'm not
diminishing anyone who fought in those
wars. consult I'm sure was terrible but
that is what it was and when you lose in
Iraq it's an abstract thing it's an
abstract thing you you Iran come into
the power vacuum it is some you know
regional dynamic all that kind of thing
but it's very abstract maybe for
everyone except Israel okay it probably
actually matters for Israel directly but
for everyone else in the west it's
abstract and what I see in Europe right
now not so much in America but what I
see in Europe among the European leaders
I think just in Kiev recently is they're
beginning to wake up to what it means to
lose a war to really lose a war because
when you lose a war things change elites
get tossed out etc etc and you can kind
of see that coming down the coming down
you know you're seeing kind of the the
light in the distance that's a train
coming like it's a train I'm not saying
the Russians are going to invade Europe
or anything I think all that stuff's
rubbish I'm just saying that losing wars
has consequences economies change
afterwards elites change afterwards
security architectures exchange
afterwards. I mean, just to say when the
Trump administration first got in, they
made indications which I think will end
up coming through that the Americans
will end up partnering with the Russians
on various projects, for example, in the
Arctic, maybe in Central Asia and so on.
I think this will probably end up
happening. And the Europeans were
shocked at this. They said, "But I
thought you were their ally." And you
almost say to somebody, "Pick up a
history book, guys. When when a when a
major power backs a minor power in a
conflict and the minor power loses, they
always turn around and shake hands with
the victor. But people haven't they have
the the historical perspective since the
collapse of the Cold War has become so
poor because we've become quite a
decadent society, let's be honest, that
these leadership, these PowerPoint
merchants have just forgotten what it
means to lose a war. It's it's like
somebody who's got into a into a way too
serious situation that they don't
understand. Like some some high some
secondary school kid or something is
kind of playing around wants to be a
gangster or something like that and
suddenly like he's in the middle of a
gang war and people are taking guns out
and it's like oh this this is real life
you know.
So one of the other crucial events to
the sort of ongoing collapse of western
liberal hygemony that you alluded to
earlier is the Houthi attacks on the Red
Sea shipping lane. So why is this so
crucial to this ongoing
collapse? Again I think this is a this
is a this is a question of a surprise
that's very easy to to read some sort of
logic into and you do have to in
retrospect, you know, read some logic
into it. But again, I think it's a
surprise. Iran Iran backed the Houthis.
They continue to back these and they
backed them as part of a regional
strategy to keep uh to keep Israel in an
unstable position, shall we say. Um but
I think I think up until the war in
Gaza, their main uh they saw their main
proxy as still being Hezbollah in the
north and to a more limited extent Hamas
and the Gaza Strip. Um, and I think the
Houthis have turned out to be a complete
dark horse because I think even the
Iranians who obviously have invested
extremely heavily in missile technology.
Um, copying other countries by the way
like China and Russia, they've just I
I'm pretty sure the Iranian designs are
just old Chinese designs. Um, they
they've invested in that massively and
they backed the Houthis on the basis
that that's what the Houthis were going
to end up being useful for. Although
they backed them in a land war previous
to that against the Saudis, don't
forget. So then they were just seen as a
kind of a conventional force. Um and
they won that war effectively against
the Saudis. Um but what's happened here
is that this small group um which people
thought were quite primitive and in a
sense maybe they are um have been given
these advanced but not hyper advanced
missiles. I reckon, look, it's nobody
really knows, but my guess is they're
Chinese missile designs from the 1990s
and early 2000s, maybe with newer um
targeting systems welded onto them.
Probably at this stage, you can buy that
stuff from AliExpress. And drones, of
course, drones are very important, too.
But I think it's the missile technology
in the Houthi case that's particularly
interesting. And what the Houthis are
proving in real time is two things, two
related things. First of all, they're
proving that you can um engage in a
naval blockade without navy. Now, some
people I've I've said this I said this
on Navaro a couple of year two years ago
or a year and a half ago or something
and I did get push back and people said
well you know people have
mined seas and stuff before and that's
true but I I think what we're seeing now
is a is a fundamentally different um
different phenomena. I think they've
basically this is the first land-based
force that's truly been able to enact an
ongoing naval blockade. You could lay a
bunch of mines on the Red Sea and then
you'd clear the mines and that will be
the end of the story, right? But this is
an ongoing naval blockade which there is
probably no way to break it in a sense
without um entering into some sort of a
negotiation with the Houthis or with
their backers or whoever controls this
thing. But what it's shown as well um
related to that is that um is that much
of the naval power that the Anglo world
I'd say is focused on but also France I
mean France is into this too um but
mainly the Anglo world and this goes
right back to the British Empire to the
ability to control shipping lanes and so
on but
this we thought that the aircraft
carrier solved the problem of um of
naval power. Basically, the problem with
naval power was that once aircraft came
on the scenes, big dreadnots weren't
very impressive anymore because aircraft
could harass and destroy them and so on.
And the aircraft carrier was thought to
be a a solution to that. And we're
seeing that it probably wasn't. And in
fact, it probably was never. I think
this is probably another instance where
the tech just never really got tried. I
mean, I I say in the book, and I think
it's accurate, that the first um
anti-shipping ballistic missiles were uh
Japanese zeros loaded up with explosives
and a and a suicidal pilot pilot. Um and
then you know once the missile and but
and the missile technology to do that
was already protodeveloped at the end of
the second world war in the in the form
of the V1 and V2 rocket systems but
really came into being I'd say you
probably credible anti-bballist
anti-shipping missiles by the 1970s when
the aircraft carrier was supposedly
reading reaching its kind of zenith. So
I think that technology is being
disproved in real time in the Red Sea.
Um the the US in their latest venture,
the Trump anti-huthy venture, has lost
two planes. Um we're not really sure how
they lost them. The first one was said
to have fallen off the side of the ship
while they were turning, maybe to avoid
a missile. We don't know. The second
one,
well, I'm not going to make any
predictions. I'm sure it's all very
classified, but uh I joked on Twitter
that a Bermuda triangle had opened up
over the Red Sea. It could be that the
Houthies are hitting uh hitting these
ships at this point because what's the
again this goes back to the economics of
the case, not this nonsense GDP metric
economic stuff. The basic economics of
the case are that the Houthis have a
potentially infinite number of uh
anti-ship missiles, drone systems, etc.,
et, etc., and the ships have a limited
battery of anti-air defense of air
defense um uh uh weapons. Not only do
they have a limited battery, but they're
way more expensive. I think the average
interceptor on those things is about a
million dollars. The average drone, if
they're using shah or something, it's
like
$20,000. And I don't really know how
much the Iranian missiles they're using
are, but I doubt they're more than 100
grand each. Maybe 150 for the
anti-shipping ones. Not for the
ballistic ones that they're currently
firing into Israel, but the the
anti-shipping ones, I guess they're 150
grand. So, you have a 10 to1 ratio on
that. Oh, and by the way, you usually
need to fire at least two interceptors
for every um for every missile fired
just to try and get a hit and some of
them get through. So, you don't even
have to go into the cost. I mean, the
cost of a the value of the aircraft
carrier itself is I think over 20
billion and there's 5,000 people on
board on a on a carrier battle group.
So, the economics of this just make
absolutely no sense anymore. And so, I
think we're reverting back to a very
very we're going to a very different
form of warfare. um where effectively I
think and this plays into the mult
multipolar world and this is actually
quite I think personally this is quite
an optimistic view is that offensive
weaponry is no longer very effective and
defensive weaponry is enormously
effective but isn't that I don't think
that's a terrible thing because that
actually means that if you that that uh
the division of multipolar uh a
multipolar global system with countries
that aren't interested in interfering
too much with the rest of the world, but
are interested in their own defense.
Have a very credible means of just
sitting there toled up with missiles. If
they're big enough, they'll have nuclear
weapons and it's like a porcupine or
something like no one will go near it.
So, in a sense, it could be quite
optimistic, but it completely blows out
of the water all these old notions that
come from the British imperial days of
uh you control the world when you
control the shipping lands. That's not
happening anymore. And now that the
shipping lanes have become so um so um
unpredictable, you'll see increasing use
of rail and so on. Not just in Eurasia,
although that's coming. The new Silk
Road is coming and the Americans aren't
going to stop it. Um but they'll also
we'll also probably see it in um in
places like Latin America. A friend of
mine actually I was having lunch with uh
him. He's going off to DC at the moment
and he pointed out to me that um that
even the Panama Canal is completely like
irrelevant now. The Trump guys are
talking about the Panama Canal, but the
new uh uh rapid loading AI port
technology means that you can just run a
railroad across and you can just you can
just put all the stuff on, ship it up,
offload in two hours onto the train,
train it across much quicker, much
simpler, and then take it off on the
other side. The the the canal technology
was only there because it was so
difficult to um uh load ships, but it's
no longer true. So, um, so this these
old, uh, uh, notions of global power
that come from, uh, from from the
British imperial era are going to have
to be thrown out. And I wish I'd written
about them more in the book, but these
are the cores. These are the core
aspects of geopolitical doctrine that
you're going to be taught. Mckinder and
all this stuff. It's all out of date.
It's probably been out of date for a
long time, actually, but it's completely
out of date now. So, we're going to have
to update the software on a lot of them
stuff.
Yeah, that's really fascinating. Um, uh,
we we touched on a few points there. Um,
I think something that's particularly
relevant in terms of, uh, sort of
sketching out how the sort of British
professional managerial class or even
the political class don't really get it
is uh, I think yesterday or day before
Star mentioned in a in a private meeting
that uh, that the defense industry would
be the engine of national revival. Um,
which is totally at odds with what we've
just discussed. Um to what extent do you
think this kind of instinct is is um how
would you say sort of uh associated with
the kind of um Atlanticist ideology that
that we have in government is that for a
long time um we've relied on this kind
of relationship with the United States
um which has included um for the best
part of the last two decades
accompanying them on their sort of
foreign adventures. um how has that
influenced the way that we think about
uh about sort of global
power? I mean the British case is
particularly unique. The two um the two
countries I'd say outside of Israel in
the West that are most threatened by the
developments in the multipolar world
long term long-term don't get me wrong
are probably Britain and Ireland.
They're very unique cases and it's
because they've stitched themselves so
much into the American project. Um, I
won't talk about Ireland. Much more
simple. It's massive FDI. There's a
great economist in Ireland who's come to
call it the multinational
potato after what happened during the
famine. I think it's a good one. Um, but
look, we'll talk about Britain.
Ireland's only a small country anyways.
I mean, I'm Irish, so I care about it.
But, um, uh, but Britain Britain
basically they've done what you've said.
They've stitched their entire global
strategy into um into the American
global liberal strategy. And what that's
done is it's it's meant that they
haven't uh put behind them the we rule
the world mindset. Um and that has been
that is going to create great
difficulties in the future. not just in
terms of retraining diplomatic cores and
so on which will have to be done um but
also just the legacy of that for a very
long time I mean Britain given its size
given its relative of power which is not
much on the world stage let's be frank
it's um its optimal position if you
abstract from all the other you know all
of what's happened historically is
basically to try and be friends with
everyone it's an economy it's an island
economy it it basically doesn't have any
threats to it at all. Um, and so you try
and be friends with everyone. You take a
kind of um, uh, uh, that kind of
approach. And of course, having gone
along with the global liberal project,
they um, Britain's done precisely the
opposite. They've taken sides in pretty
much every every conflict. I think
they've implicitly at least taken a side
in the recent IndiaPakistan conflict,
for example.
um this is not a wise strategy from
Britain's perspective unless you think
that this global empire pays dividends
in some way. So their geopolitical
strategy not only will it have to be
entirely rewritten which will take an
awful lot of time and effort it's going
to take such a massive change of mindset
institutional mindset and so on.
Although I will say knowing some people
who've worked for the foreign office, I
think a lot of people there at a
practical level. I don't understand this
to be honest. Um and they're often
overridden at a political level or uh at
an MOD level, which is a really
interesting thing if you want to go into
the politics in Britain. But um but I
think okay so there's that but then
there's the real big problem because
that's a problem of institutional
reorganization and then you have to try
and reset um uh a load of relationships
globally that um uh let's say there's
some hysteresus built into will be the
polite way of putting it. Um but the
problem the more hard problem and I
won't even come to military technology
and so on because I don't think Britain
needs much of a military in multipolar
world but whatever but no the real hard
problem is economic because Britain
stitched itself to the um to the
American system and it's done so in a
very particular way. I'll just give a
really brief rundown of what happened to
Britain in the 20th century. Um the
British economic model in the 19th
century, it's very ironic. It was always
said to be based on free trade. Um but
it wasn't. It was based on free trade
within the empire. It was a closed
system. And it's described very well in
K Marxist Dascapal. Um where he
describes uh cotton being taken from
India, raw cotton being taken from India
being brought to Britain uh to uh
process in British factories. The
financing for this trade uh takes place
in the city of London. That's
effectively where the city of London
comes from. And then the cotton uh the
cotton products are sold back to
Indians. They're sold domestically, but
they're also sold back to Indians. And
India, I think, are running a trade
deficit within the empire that's being
propped up effectively by um by lending
by the British. And that system
basically carries on until the inter war
period when the empire starts to
collapse. Um now the issue with that is
that it meant that British manufacturing
uh we don't really know when but my
guess is late 19th century uh wasn't
actually globally competitive. It was
only really competitive within the
imperial system. I think by the end of
the 19th century uh Germans probably
already caught up and Americans probably
already caught up. So it's probably it's
probably not competitive for a good 40
years there. And then you go into the
inter war period of turmoil with the
screw-ups with the gold standard,
churchill, all that. I won't go into the
history too much, but um that's
basically the the collapse of the
imperial system. And in fact, really
interestingly, because I was fascinated
with this once, the person with the
clearest view of what's happening in
that period is actually Oswald Mosley,
which is a very strange side note, but
he's actually quite sophisticated from
an economics point of view. He's good
friends with John Mayor Kanes, and he
talks very extensively. He criticizes
Kanes for not recognizing that the
imperial system is completely uh
necessary for the functioning of the
economy. And I think he actually has a
stronger uh side in that debate.
Interestingly, forgotten period in
history. Anyway, after the Second World
War, can't afford the empire anymore. Uh
not working anyway. Probably wasn't any
saving it. Um and uh they hand the baton
to the United States, not really
understanding that they've done so until
the Suez crisis in 56, but they figure
it out. And after that, sterling goes
into a long period of decline. I think
in 1945, sterling is worth
$450 if my memory serves me correctly.
And it goes down and down and down. And
some of these are big crises. The
devaluation under Wilson uh ' 67 I
think. And then there's an IMF bailout
in 76. Um so this is a long period of of
decline. And what you're seeing is that
that manufacturing which had been
insulated from global forces for a long
time in the second world war it became
enormous but it was completely insulated
from global forces. It was basically a
closed closed economic system and it was
a pl borderline planned economy and um
it unwinds. it unwinds completely and um
I think probably at some point maybe in
the 80s maybe in the early 90s there was
a chance for Britain to maintain a
modest econ manufacturing sector perhaps
like a country like France or something
like that not of the scale of Germany
but perhaps of France but instead of
that um they went with the finance model
which started in 1986 with the big bang
under that had to do with high interest
rates in Britain there's a whole thing
about that but basically what happened
was um almost by accident, but it then
became kind of planned. Um part of Wall
Street landed in Britain in the city of
London and started to prop up enormous
trade deficits. And basically what
happened without going into the
macroeconomics of it too much, but what
happened was sterling became a sort of a
mini dollar. It became a it hung on to
the dollar's coattails as the global
reserve currency. It was never a global
reserve currency, bad currency as a
global reserve currency because it kept
falling in value, which is not good for
a reserve currency. But because the city
was able to carve out a unique space in
the in the Wall Street model, we'll call
it. Um, I won't go into what that unique
space was, but it was able to do that
for a period. um you were able to get
sufficient financial inflows into
Britain to prop up living standards uh
and to run increasingly massive trade
deficits to the extent that they're now
so large that you'd associate these with
like a country that's addicted to
foreign aid in Africa or something like
that. Really dangerous levels of uh
current account deficit. Even if I saw
those in America, I think they peaked I
think one quarter the peak was 6.8% of
GDP. Something like that. Crazy numbers.
like that's not sustainable at all. And
so that's where Britain is right now. At
the same time, the dollar is clearly at
this point collapsing as a global
reserve currency, which maybe we can
talk about later because it's happening
in real time since liberation day now,
but it's been in the p in the cards for
a while now. Um, and I think that the
British model is under enormous threat.
And what would that mean? Well, if the
if the financialization Wall Street
model starts to crumble, which I think
it is, um, those deficits are going to
have to close. those um trade deficits
and in order to close them the do the
sterling is going to have to fall in
value quite substantially. Exports don't
really become more competitive in that
environment because manufacturing's been
effectively eviscerated. they do become
a little bit more competitive but to a
large extent no we can talk about that
more if you want but it has to do with
the fact that a lot of the finished
products in Britain require a lot of
imported inputs and so when the currency
goes down the inputs go up and right so
you stitch it into global supply chains
it doesn't work like a normal currency
adjustment and um so what's really
happening is the imports become more
expensive and what that means is 30% of
uh a British shopping basket
approximately is imported And you
probably know that if you go down into
your local Tesco, that stuff goes down.
Stuff goes up in price and it's just
crushing on living standards. And on top
of that, um there's already a borderline
fiscal crisis in the country. I hate to
be so pessimistic, but it, you know,
Britain's Britain's in a terrible pickle
at the end of this. Um Ireland is too
sadly, but yeah.
So, uh I guess shifting focus back to
the sort of US UK relationship here. Um,
so it definitely looks as though not
only is this economic situation
unsustainable, but also that perhaps
with the comments we've seen from Vance
recently about Europe not wanting to be
a permanent security vessel of the
United States, um, do does the UK and
and also perhaps the rest of Europe
really need to be kind of dragged
kicking and screaming into forming a
more independent foreign policy?
Well, I mean, they will have to. I mean,
you know, it's that old the one law in
economics, as they always say, is what
can't go on won't go on. And uh this is
a case of that. You know, they're going
to have to form some new uh foreign
policy, the Europeans. Right now,
they're mistaking that for having to
form a military policy, which in my
opinion won't work. Does um does Europe
need to remilitarize? Yeah. Yeah,
probably. I mean, you know, you probably
want some sort of a defense capability,
but you know, that's a long-term project
and if you try and rush that, you're
going to screw it up. And they're trying
to rush it. So, they're almost
definitely going to screw it up. And we
saw that in Poland already. So, yeah,
they probably do need to kind of build
up their military forces and so on. But,
you know, I always point this out like
imagine in the imagine like it's true
that the Russians want to invade the
whole of Europe. I don't think it's
true, but let's say that it is true. by
the time they get to the French, you
know, by the time they're approaching
Paris, you have a nuclear exchange. So,
let's not forget that the the nuclear um
the French are a nuclear power.
Britain's a nuclear power, although the
Trident doesn't seem to be working.
That's a separate issue. But um the the
the French are are a nuclear power. So,
can anyone explain, you know, this to
me? Um should couldn't Germany just have
some nuclear missiles uh if they want an
effective deterrence? Nobody talks about
this. The the reason for that, I think,
is that look, I don't want to impugn
anyone's motives, but I I really well,
maybe I do. Um, but I really do suspect
that some people who are talking about
the Russians turning on the rest of
Europe and invading it now aren't being
are being disingenuous, to be honest.
And the and the issue here is that
they're that it has real consequences
because they're
overfocusing on trying to remitize the
continent, which will not work because
that's a long-term project. That's like
saying, "I want to re-industrialize
Britain." It's like, "Yeah, okay, but I
want to do it in a year." Okay, well,
you're not going to do it in a year.
You're just going to engage in a bunch
of grifting. Okay, you're going to like
throw money around and people are going
to steal the money. That's what's going
to happen. So, don't do that. Come back
to me with a 20-year plan. That's what
you need to re-industrialize Britain.
Same for for um for the for the for for
a European military just to get people
back in the mindset of joining a
military. I'm in Budapest at the moment
and they they've been very good about
maintaining their military throughout.
They've hit the spending targets over
and over again. Now, they're trying to
increase recruitment, I think, because
they've realized that land forces aren't
irrelevant anymore. And, you know,
there's a concerted effort to like put
out they're putting out movies that
advertise the the um you know,
attractiveness of going into the army,
that it's a kind of a a sexy job and
like desirable and stuff. That's what
you need. This is gradual. You have to
change the culture among young people.
You have to make sure that they're
they're going into the military, by the
way, going into the army for the right
reasons. There's a lot of people in in
Western militaries, I'll be frank, in
Europe especially, who are not there for
the right reasons. They're there for
free money. They're there to get a
college degree. Okay, these aren't
anyway, that's a whole different thing.
But the the so they're overfocused on
this military thing, which is, as the
kids say, a LAR. It's it's fake. And I
think I'm increasingly coming to suspect
that it's it's it's actually a a
reaction on the part part of a lot of
these um this foreign policy
establishment in Europe that's been
built around NATO that's going to lose
access to funding. And I mean I don't
mean that in oh they're looting the
place. No, I really mean it just like
for their events, you know, to keep the
ship afloat in a sense. like there's an
entire apparatus built around the
security architecture in Europe that
keeps a lot of people on uh keeps a lot
of people employed. And I wonder if some
of this military spending isn't um isn't
just being used to prop that up, but
that won't last. So they're overly
focused on this remilitarization
question, which is a much longer term
question. It's not something we need in
a year. If it is something we need in a
year, we're finished. Okay. But I don't
think it is. and they're not focusing on
what you're talking about, which is
absolutely possible to do, which is
retool your farm policy strategy. Pour
some pour some of that that money that
you're going to waste into developing
like actual think tanks and stuff that
are focused on European foreign policy
strategy, security architecture, these
kind of things. What what we were what
we all wanted until 2022, which is not
more war. We want to find some way of
living in the world together, trading
with each other, not murdering each
other, not being in constant conflict,
having reasonably good diplomatic
relations and so on. But my fear is that
that they that the capital right now is
forming around this remilitarization
strategy that's not going to work.
Rather, it should be forming around a
broader discussion uh about what this
new world order means and how we're
going to live in it. And the last thing
I'd say about that
is people would not talk about the
multipolarity issue abstract from the
liberal issue. People would not talk
about the multiplarity issue at all for
the past where are we three years.
They've started talking about it now,
but they're trying to blame it on Trump.
I saw the Economist uh this week had a
beaten up uh American Eagle on it and it
said like
1,369 days left like as if like oh it's
Trump's fault. Where were they in the B?
It's was the Biden administration mainly
that pushed the push the eagle out of
the nest, you know, let's let's be
frank. And the Trump administration is
mainly reacting and being h hel handed a
very bad set of circumstances. Not
saying they're not making mistakes on
their own, but that's the reality. Now
look, on the one hand that's juvenile
and it's subintellectual and it's
annoying, but on the other hand, like if
that's the attitude people are going to
have, yes, these global changes are
happening, but it's because of the the
orange goblin. Like that's not serious.
So the so there needs to be like this
the thing is this is so doable. This
doesn't require getting your
manufacturing back in line. It doesn't
it doesn't mean changing to a more
marshall culture. It doesn't mean
finding good army recruits. It those are
really complex things that'll take a
long time. This wouldn't actually take a
long time. It's just like have a
realistic debate about it. Stop living
in fantasy world. Throw some money
behind this. Realize that a lot of the
mores that the boomers had just aren't
going to fly anymore. And that moral
condemnation of China like isn't a real
foreign policy position. So look, you'll
have to break a few eggs with that like
intellectually or whatever, but it's
doable.
Yeah. Yeah. um you you um you mentioned
in the book just on the topic of um a
kind of foreign policy realignment um in
Europe that the sort of eastward
expansion of of NATO um was a a policy
that was pursued despite and I think the
terms you use are um you know it was it
was a form it was an example of a policy
that could result in one's own country
becoming poorer and less stable. Um, now
to play devil's advocate, a sort of
liberal IR theorist might say to you
that um, you know, the idea that we
should spread liberal values or spread
democracy, um, even leaving aside the
fact that it's a sort of morally good
thing to do, um, there's evidence to
suggest that it would produce less
conflict in the world and therefore mean
that we wouldn't need to pursue this
sort of remilitarization strategy. Um,
what do you make of that argument? It's
been falsified. I mean like these big
abstract arguments that aren't based on
anything I don't have much truck with to
begin with to be honest with you. It's
like well in theory if we just spread
liberalism everywhere why second world
war or something like that's not an
argument like sorry I'm an economist I
don't like that's like you might as well
hand me a book on French literature
literature theory like I'll read Dared
or something like if I want really
abstract arguments like that. I don't
it's not like it's not I don't know what
that means. It's like the the tusidities
trap or whatever. It's like what I don't
understand. It sounds like a
deterministic argument about something
that's really complex and historically
grounded and people have a choice in etc
etc. I don't I don't get those kind of
abstract theories. I I never really
have. Um but you know to the extent that
it can be falsified it's been falsified.
And by the way it keeps being falsified.
This was the same argument that they
made about Iraq and it caused complete
chaos in the Middle East. But it's just
so obvious to my mind. It's just so
obviously absurd like that there's that
there there it's it's a liberal thing.
It's it's a highly ideological idea of
mankind which is that just like the
communists used to think that there's a
new man residing in the heart of every
human being, right? And maybe even a few
monkeys as well. And you can just go out
and you can show them the way and you
can engage in some propaganda and you
can overthrow a bad dictator. You know,
everyone is Hitler. Get rid of the
Hitler. Get rid of the little Hitler or
whatever. And then oh my god, the inner
liberal will just come out.
Like this is this is the kind of
thinking that you you have to call uh a
re revolutionary radical. It's the kind
of thinking that you'd attribute to
Jacabans, to Bolsheviks, and so on. And
it's just the liberals. I'm kind of gl
I'm I'm it caused so much chaos, so I
want to be careful my words here, but
I'm kind of glad that the liberals
finally got to that point because it
unmasked their entire project. It was
never the reasonable project that they
were making it out to be. The the the
Jacabans were the original liberals and
you, oh well, that was very radical
liberalism. We're much more this and
that. No, it always tends in that
direction. That's what I'm arguing in
the book because it's based on an
abstract tabular raza view of man just
like communism is. And anytime you have
an ideology like that, the the the basic
um the basic uh idea that that's driving
it is if we can just turn everybody into
this this new man, this liberal man,
this communist man, whatever, then the
world's going to reach utopia. And I've
just never of course this comes from the
Christian tradition which is the evangel
evangelizing religion. But the Christian
tradition on evangelization is
completely different. You're for example
not allowed to evangelize at the point
of a gun for one. It has to be
consensual and so on. But there's also
respect for other cultures. You know
Christianity is very famous in in taking
the pagan culture that they encounter
and then channeling it into a local form
of Christianity and so on. So the the
the Christians are much more realistic
about this. But it comes from that
married to an enlightenment idea that
you can reduce people to to widgets to
to logical structures or something like
that. And of course this is the anytime
a project like that is pursued it
eventually hits flesh. Flesh, right? It
eventually hits flesh and you realize,
oh wait, people don't behave like the
liberals say. there's innate
characteristics in human beings. I
personally believe in natural law
theory, but even if you don't, like I
think I think anyone who rejects
complete abstractionism will fall back
on, I don't know, the the common sense
stuff that you'd find in Scot Scottish
Enlightenment, something like that. You
can come up with many different versions
of this. I think the natural law stuff
is fine. But anytime you fall back on
that, you realize, no, eventually your
abstract ideas are going to meet flesh.
And they have every single time. There's
been no instance where this has been
successful outside of the lines that
were basically drawn in this in the
Second World War, right? I mean, there's
been none uh since then. Yeah. So, the
last successful quote unquote successful
uh um I'd say liberal imperial or
whatever you want to call it uh uh
project was Korea and it resulted in a
demilitarized zone, a highly liberal
South Korea which is collapsing under
its own contradictions now with its low
birth rate and various other problems
and a communist North Korea who are
weirdly in a sense the
trady and the and the main pack two
bloodline and so on. I talk about it in
the book a little bit. This really
interesting tendency of hardcore
communist regimes to revert back to old
monarchical local cultural systems. I
think it's an absolutely fascinating uh
phenomenon. But that was the last one
that okay we liberalized South Korea, we
liberalized Japan after 45 liberalized
Europe which was already halfway there
because the ideas weren't that um
unusual. And then the next attempts were
Iraq disaster prior to that Russia in
the 1990s. basically a disaster and now
we have another one on in Europe which
is going to destroy the liberal projects
in Europe. Yeah. I mean it seems like
that if we want um Europeans to move
away from this kind of tendency you need
to find a way to sort of extricate um
the ideology from the u from the
political structure. I mean what what
really was quite um indicative of just
how deeply ingrained this stuff is was
the Munich Security Conference um where
the the the chair of the conference said
that you know in response to to JD Vance
basically coming and reprimanding
everyone at the conference he he said we
have to fear that our common value base
is not common anymore and concluded his
speech basically literally in tears. Um
how do you um so h how do you form this
sort of um new vision of the world when
basically the entire political class is
sort of so deeply um sort of has this
ideology so deeply embedded?
It's a tough question. I mean, look,
I'll be absolutely frank here. The you
that kind of ideological, that kind of
crude ideology drummed into people.
That's why they had to like engage in
campaigns, shall we say, in post-war
Germany and Japan. Okay? Like that's why
they had to do that. When the communist
regime collapsed, people were so cynical
with it by the end of it that there
wasn't much in the way of that left. The
Brjenev generation were the final
revolutionary generation and they were
mostly dead. The Gorbachovs of the world
were not of that generation and they
were cynical about the system and so
they didn't have that same buy in. What
you're dealing with in Europe especially
in Europe especially, I don't think it's
as bad in the United States and this is
because Europe became a vassel toward
the end of the United States and um
political officers shall we say rose
through the ranks. Um, but you're facing
that and I don't know what to do about
it. I don't know what to do about that.
How do you how like Imperial Japan loses
the war. You have a bunch of people who
are convinced that the that the emperor
is a god. Okay, they did. They were
convinced of that. Um, I'm I'm not using
the Nazi example because it'll sound
like an everyone everyone is Hitler and
I'm not trying to make that case. I'm
making a structural case about politics
here. Um, the Okay, so how do you
convince them that he's not emperor?
It's like a massive propaganda campaign
for the next 20 years. And you'll still
probably in the 60s find people
pottering around who are like, "Oh, I
don't really like what the newspapers
are saying. I really think that the
emperor is actually a god and I was
right to fight in that war." And so on.
And here we're going to get the loss of
a war, which is what it is. It's a major
loss of a major war, not as big as World
War II, but it's it's it's in the same
genre. It's not in the policing genre of
Iraq. And um and there won't be any
clear uh uh drive to do that because
frankly the if the Russians win the
first of all they're not coming into
Europe in my opinion. Maybe I'll be
proof wrong but I don't think they are.
And second of all I don't think they
would. I don't think they care. I don't
I don't think so. I don't think that's
on the cards. Um some people seem to
implicitly think it's on the cards with
some of the rhetoric you hear, but um
it's not. So, we're going to be in a
position in Europe where we have a bunch
of people kicking around who like
genuinely like believe we're one step
away from winning the liberal struggle
in Ukraine. And we're not. Like, the war
will be over. There'll be some sort of a
settlement. Hopefully, it won't be too
bad for Ukrainians. I I don't want to
sound like anti- Ukraine here. I really
feel bad for what those people have gone
through and I hope they get like a
country worth worth it afterwards. I
really do. It's so tragic. But um you
know it will be settled and the US will
probably saddle it over the Europeans's
heads. I think what's going on right now
is a bit of a inverse phony war. Um I
think the Europeans are fooling
themselves thinking they have all this
well we're tricking them into this
ceasefire. I I think I know a lot of
people in DC I think they're ignoring
the Europeans. I think they're ignoring
the European press. Once the Russians
move forward, the weapons package runs
out, all this stuff. I think they're
just going to go something's going to be
sorted out and it's going to be over the
Europeans's heads. And then if we have
all these people like pretending that
there's still some path to victory when
you know like there's a peace document
on the table like I don't know. I I
don't know because usually when this
happens in human history and a war is
lost like there's a thing
domestically and we're not going to get
that. So I don't know. I mean the best
and I'm glad I don't want Russians
occupying bloody Germany and like you
know like making everybody a Russian
vassel like 100% obviously we don't want
that but it's going to be a challenge
for like people who recognize that the
world's going to move on from this and
the challenge is going to be kind of
communicating over the well hopefully to
those people but over the heads of those
people maybe sometimes and saying look
that is not the reality of the world
anymore and unless we want to go down a
very dark path. Um, we are going to have
to figure out a new way of living in the
world. And by the way, this isn't just
about Ukraine or about Russia or
anything like that. It's also about
China. A lot of anti-Chinese sentiment
has been drummed up during this war. Um,
and you know, we can talk about China.
Is it a competitor? Are their EVs too
cheap for European markets? Those are
all perfectly reasonable questions. Do
we want them in our security apparatus?
All perfectly reasonable questions. But
hardcore ideological hate of China, I
don't think that's very productive. And
it's become, you know, like some people
think, oh, well, they supported Russia
and the war and and to some to some
extent they did economically and so on.
So, it's all of these things. And I I
don't know I don't have a simple answer
for it. I think it's going to be a very
very hard time for Europe. I think
America is going to have a much easier
time moving on from all this than
Europe.
So to sort of bring things to a close
then um for a country like the UK in the
the medium-term looking at this economic
dependency that it has with the US
economy um it's so we say institutional
inertia that you've highlighted its
unwillingness to for large parts of the
establishment to actually even
um entertain the idea of developing a
more independent foreign policy. What
are some things that if there were the
will in a place like the UK could
actually be done in the medium-term to
adapt more successfully or at least less
unsuccessfully to this emerging um less
heedgemonic, less western dominated,
less liberal dominated world order.
Well, I'm I'm working pretty hard this
summer on a particular proposal. It's in
the book actually. Um but we made I I
put it together last year. It's been
circulated with the with the Trump
administration prior like a long time
ago. It's been on the table for a long
time. Let's just put it that way. And
it's for a new Brattonwood system. It's
for a new currency system along the
lines of a can Keynesian bankor system.
I know that I to non-economists that
sound like oh some you've come up with
some crackpot economic uh means to like
solve world problems. But if you
understand um how pernicious these trade
imbalances are and how much conflict
that they can cause in the world and how
much economic dislocation and so on they
can cause um sorting out the global
trade architecture and monetary
architecture is um it it's I'm not
saying it's a silver bullet but if you
give me like one shot at the problem
that's probably the shot I'll take. And
um the tariffs as of today have failed.
Nice that we did the interview today.
They've literally failed today. the
Americans blinked and they pulled back
and no doubt the Trump administration
will will will lie about that but that's
what happened. Uh they couldn't take
them and they were facing shortages on
Walmart shelves. That's what the
president was told and it's true and um
so I think I know that the that the
Bretonwoods proposal new Bretonwoods
proposal which by the way was the
British the official British uh proposal
in Bretonwoods in 1944 because Kanes was
the delegate and delegate and he put it
on the table. uh this would be a
multilateral currency system that would
put put rules I won't go into the
details of it but it put rules in place
on global trade that would ensure
chronic imbalances uh never became a
problem again and it would be
particularly good for a country like
Britain because for Britain uh
devaluation as I said will not work in
the short term it will work in the long
term I mean eventually people will be
sufficiently poor that they'll have to
make their own stuff but uh it won't
work in the short term what's nice about
the Bankor arrangement is um if
devaluations aren't working it uh forces
FDI into the country. Um so literally
just think about uh Britain run a trade
deficit with China um devaluations of
sterling aren't closing that trade
deficit or they're closing it only on
the import side and it's overly painful
and it's judged to be overly painful.
The Chinese would be forced to start
building factories in Britain. Literally
that's how it would work. Um, so it's
and and fine, those would be
Chinese-owned, but it doesn't matter.
They'd be British jobs and they'd be
British products. Um, they'd be made in
the UK. So, just like, you know, a
Toyota factory in France or whatever.
So, um, so it it it would solve a lot of
problems. Uh, and I think the main
problems we're going to face over the
next 10 years once we've put these
conflicts to bed, which I think we're
looking at pretty much winding them down
the next couple of years, are going to
be major economic problems. and you know
the world could fall into the inter war
period and and god knows what kind of
political nasties come out of that. I
don't think we want to see it. Um and
other conflicts and so on. Um so I think
I think my silver bullet at the moment
it's not really a silver bullet but it's
close too is um pushing for a new
Bretonwood system and um trying to set
up some conferences and stuff on that
here and in DC and so on. Um, so I think
that's a pretty good venture and that's
that's pretty lowhanging fruit because
um all that needs to be done is to
convince uh the Americans and the
Chinese. I mean that's the reality. It's
it's a it's a G2 proposal. All the other
countries will fall on board and it'll
be massively in their interest to do so.
I can't really think of a single country
outside of America and China that would
um disagree with this. America the loss
is you recognize the loss of the US
dollar as reserve currency and China you
have to over time wind down your
reliance on mercantalist um surplus
trade policy. Um so I think that's
pretty lowhanging fruit. Um
but I mean there's so many other things
I I I talk about a bunch of different
issues in the book that uh that liberal
societies have have
have brought with them as massive
problems. I mean everything down to
closure of psychiatric hospitals I think
was a major um major mistake. It's the
underlying cause of homelessness, not
lack of homes. Such a we even
homelessness itself is kind of a weird
uh thing to call throwing people who
can't take care of themselves out of the
street. Um kind of a strange uh framing
in that regard, but um but you know,
there's a bunch of different things. We
we obviously need to retool our way of
looking at military. I I'm pretty
optimistic about that long term because
I think ultimately we can spend a lot
less, get a lot more, have a have a
defensebased system, a truly
defensebased system. By the way, again,
for Britain, so easy. It's an island
with these new anti-shipping
technologies and robust air defense
systems. You know, you can defend this
thing pretty easily and pretty cheaply.
Um, so there's the military aspect,
there's the there's the social and
domestic aspect. I mean, the other big
thing is going to be birth rates.
Obviously that's become actually quite
fashionable thank god. Um people have
started realizing the the ownorous uh
results of of demographic decline. Um
and that will require in Britain that
will require retooling the entire
welfare state which was just set up it
was set up to do the wrong thing. It was
set up um the TLDDR version is it was
set up in the uh with Bevon after the
war. Um, and it was set up basically to
provide short-term assistance in a full
employment economy. Um, you know,
transition from one job to another,
making sure that you don't become
homeless, I suppose we'd say today. Um,
but that is not that it's not what it
does anymore. Obviously, that's not what
the British welfare system does anymore.
It's a it's a redistribution system. It
it maintains people out of work and so
on. But this isn't a call to um do some
sort of a harsh welfare cuts or anything
like that. It's much more complicated an
issue than that. Um but we need to we
need to recognize that the that actually
probably the biggest uh social problem
facing societies today is below
replacement birth rates. And so what we
need to do is in Britain specifically
because they have such a large welfare
system, retool that welfare system
around families. That does not mean
throwing the poor out in their ear.
There are ways to do that without being,
you know, really harsh and neoliberal
about it. Um, but, uh, that needs to be
the underlying assumption. There needs
to be an underlying assumption baked
into it that the that the social support
system is based around the family. And
that may even go up to aspects. I've
been thinking about it recently. Some a
friend of mine here was talking to me
about the issues with pensions here in
Hungary. And uh I realized that that
pensions were even becoming a a big
problem just um even with a reasonable
family policy in place. And then I
started thinking, you know, thankfully
in Hungary there's still a kind of a a
um a culture of taking care of your
parents when they're old. It's not a
care home society. And I thought uh gez,
you know, you could restructure the
family benefits project around that. You
know, like young people actually do take
care of their grandparents here. It's
actually very charming. And um and I
thought, gez, you know, you could stitch
the the family benefits in some way and
to kind of, you know, like if you're
putting in some effort into taking your
elderly grandparents some cheese or
something like that, like maybe you can
stitch that into the benefit system or
something. The logical way to do it
because I was explaining, you know, you
can't just you can't just juice up the
pensions like there's we'll have to cut
something else. We'll have to cut the
family benefit system then and so on. So
that's a big complex system and it it's
it's it it means that every aspect of
state assistance and state subsidy from
the pensions right down to the welfare
system, right down to the income tax
systems and everything like that, how
we're going to run taxation policy,
you're going to have to restructure the
entire um you're going to have to
restructure the entire framework around
maximizing uh family formation and
fertility and taking care of elderly
people unless we want to go into um soil
and green territory. I'm really actually
frightened by that. It sounds flippant
of me to say that, but I'm I'm serious
about that. It's scary. Um, so I think I
think working on these issues, there's
lots to be done. I think there's so many
good ideas kind of floating around in
the ether right now. Um, and we just
kind of have to get to it to it. But
right now, our in Europe at least are
for the next couple of years, I just I
can't see us getting getting out of the
way of obsessed with this conflict,
militarization, all this. And it's we're
falling behind. You know, the Americans,
for all the for all the problems with
the Trump administration, they're
they're kind of moving the ship in the
right
direction. They might crash it before
they get her back on course, but we'll
see.
It's been a fascinating Yeah, a really
great discussion. Thank you so much for
your time and uh for taking the time to
to speak to us and share your insights.
So, the book is The Collapse of Global
Liberalism with Policy Press. That will
be available by the time this is
released and we'll put a link where you
can viewers access it. Um, before we
finish, Philip, is there anywhere else
you would suggest people go to to follow
your work?
Um, no, not really. I mean, my Twitter
account, but it's kind of snarky. If you
like snarky Twitter accounts, you can
follow the snarky Twitter account. Um,
we're I'm I'm doing stuff with the
Hungarian Institute of International
Affairs at the moment. I think we're
putting out some pretty interesting
papers from time to time. Um, the
Bratton Woods proposal was originally
published by them. Um, so there's some
interesting stuff uh coming out of that.
I'm trying to think of anything else.
Not really. The podcast multiplarity of
the podcast. Like and subscribe, share
with your family, whatever. I'll do the
podcast dance. Um, but yeah, in general,
um, uh, the book, uh, I think I think
the book's kind of a a comprehensive
document. I'm hoping it kind of it kind
of penetrates or whatever. It's got some
good endorsements so far and um, the
reviews are lining up. So, I'm quite
excited for release day for for
liberation day come uh March May 31st or
whatever it is. Brilliant. Well, thank
you again and thanks everyone for
watching. We're going to uh conclude
there.
